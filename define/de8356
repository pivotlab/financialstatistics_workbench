## definition
This is the value, as at the relevant date, of sold precious metal call options, consistent with the classification and measurement basis used for derivatives by institutions in accordance with accounting standards.

A sold call option is a call option that has been sold, or written, by an entity. It provides the selling entity with the obligation to pay or receive a specific amount of money based on a pre-agreed interest rate, on or before a specific future date, if and when exercised by the holder of the option position.

A precious metal is a classification of metals that are considered to be rare and/or have high economic value and silver, platinum and palladium, but exclude gold.

A gold contract is any contract that transfers the gold price risk associated with an underlying asset from one party to another.

Derivatives are generally defined as those instruments/contracts, where the value is based on other products, and/or on prices associated with financial products. Derivative contracts involve:
- Future delivery, receipt or exchange of financial items such as cash or another derivative instrument; or
- Future exchange of real assets for financial items where the contract may be tradeable and has a market value.
The contracts can either be binding on both parties (e.g. as with a currency swap) or subject to the exercise by one party of a right contained within the contract (as with options).

Report this item regardless of whether favourable or unfavourable to the reporting entity.
