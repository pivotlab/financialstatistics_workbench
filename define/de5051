## definition
In reporting this item the reporting party is to follow the basis that is used for the preparation of the annual financial statements in accordance with the Australian accounting standards. Actuarial valuations and calculations used in deriving the value of the item must be in accordance with prudential standards.

Report the principal amount of the non-market related off-balance sheet contingent liabilities relating to formal standby facilities or credit lines.

A formal standby facility or credit line is a formalised arrangement in which the counterparty has the right but not the obligation to draw down funds to a specified limit.

The principal amount refers to the face value or gross amount of a given off-balance sheet transaction and not the fair value. The principal amount must be reported as a positive value, even for short positions in derivative financial instruments.
