## definition
This is the value, as at the relevant date, of the central estimate of expected reinsurance recoveries receivable by the reporting entity associated with the premiums liabilities. This item is to be determined in accordance with relevant prudential standards. 

The central estimate will be measured as the present value of the future expected reinsurance recoveries, i.e. discounted for future investment income, determined in accordance with relevant prudential standards. The central estimate is intended to reflect the mean value in the range of possible values for the outcome (that is, the mean of the distribution of probabilistic outcomes), and so does not include any risk margin.

Expected reinsurance recoveries means any amounts due to an insurer, or to an entity that carries on international business within a Level 2 insurance group, from a reinsurer that arise from the recognition of premiums liabilities referred to in the GI Prudential Standards. This is distinguished from reinsurance recoverables.
