## definition
Report the net market value, or fair value, of equity investments or securities, plus income accrued but not received in relation to this asset. This method of disclosure differs from the Australian Accounting Standards.

Equity investments or securities are, as defined by the Australian Accounting Standards, contracts that evidence a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all its liabilities. 

Net market value, or fair value, is the amount which could be expected to be received from the disposal of an asset in an orderly market; or in an arm's length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties; after deducting costs expected to be incurred in realising the proceeds of such a disposal.
