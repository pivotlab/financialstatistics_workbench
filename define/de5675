## definition
Report the admissible value of assets where the actuary has considered that non-standard resilience factors are appropriate, as per the solvency standard. 

This should only be used in rare cases. It is intended to cover situations where assets are disaggregated into (1) an identifiable sub-asset and (2) a residual that does not fit into any of the asset sectors specified by Life Insurance Prudential Standards for resilience purposes, or where a non-standard resilience risk has been modelled in accordance with Life Insurance Prudential Standards.

The admissible value is the net market value of all assets where the actuary has considered that non-standard resilience factors are appropriate, less the value of those deemed to be inadmissible, as per the solvency standard. 

The inadmissible assets are: 
a) assets which have a value that is dependent upon the continuation of the business;
b) holdings in an associated or subsidiary entity which is a Financial Services entity;
c) non-realisable (in the context of the solvency tests) intangible assets;
d) assets with too little diversification, are too illiquid or have too great an exposure to one obligor of low credit standing;
e) reinsurance assets which may not be fully recoverable in the context of the solvency tests; and
f) amounts by which the recorded value of an asset exceeds its net realisable value.

Net market value, or fair value, is the amount which could be expected to be received from the disposal of an asset in an orderly market; or in an arm's length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties; after deducting costs expected to be incurred in realising the proceeds of such a disposal.
