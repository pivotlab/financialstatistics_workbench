In reporting this item the reporting party is to follow the basis that is used for the preparation of the annual financial statements in accordance with the Australian accounting standards. Actuarial valuations and calculations used in deriving the value of the item must be in accordance with prudential standards.

Report the principal amount of trade-related contingencies. These are non-market related off-balance sheet contingent liabilities arising from trade-related obligations that are secured against an underlying shipment of goods.
This includes but is not limited to:
- documentary letters of credit issued;
- acceptances on trade bills;
- shipping guarantees issued; and
- any other trade-related contingencies.

The principal amount refers to the face value or gross amount of a given off-balance sheet transaction and not the fair value. The principal amount must be reported as a positive value, even for short positions in derivative financial instruments.
