## definition
This is the value at risk (VaR), calculated as at the relevant date, for positions giving rise to market risk, as determined in accordance with relevant prudential standards.

Market risk positions include holdings of, or positions giving rise to:
     - interest rate risk;
     - equity position risk;
     - foreign exchange risk; and
     - commodities risk.

VaR, or Value at Risk, is a technique used to estimate the likelihood of losses in a portfolio based on analysis of historical price movements and volatilities over a specified observation period.

For the purposes of this item the amount reported is the 99% ten-day VaR number calculated as at the relevant date. Therefore, the number reported will represent a simulated mark-to-market loss for which there is a 1% probability of occurrence over the next ten days, assuming there is no trading of the portfolio.
