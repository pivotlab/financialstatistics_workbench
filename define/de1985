## type

## definition
This is the value, during the relevant period, for unrealised gains/losses on funds placed with external investment managers in the form of individually managed mandates or discretely managed portfolios where the asset portfolio is tailored for or chosen by the entity.

Unrealised gains/losses:
The change in the net market value is the increase or decrease in the market value of each asset compared to the value of that asset at the beginning of the reporting period. These assets are still owned by the entity at the end of the period, they have not been disposed of, and as a result, the gains or losses on the assets are unrealised. If the assets are disposed of during the period, then the gains or losses are realised.
Only include the movement in the net market value of the asset. Do not include the movement in the value of the currency relative to the Australian dollar (AUD) if the asset is denominated in a currency other than the AUD.
