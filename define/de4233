## definition
Report the net market value, or fair value, of borrowings, including overdrafts. This method of disclosure differs from the Australian Accounting Standards.

Borrowings are amounts of money on loan from financial institutions or other creditors with the promise or understanding that it will be repaid.

Net market value, or fair value, is the amount which could be expected to be received from the disposal of an asset in an orderly market; or in an arm's length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties; after deducting costs expected to be incurred in realising the proceeds of such a disposal.
