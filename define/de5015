## definition
In reporting this item the reporting party is to follow the basis that is used for the preparation of the annual financial statements in accordance with the Australian accounting standards. Actuarial valuations and calculations used in deriving the value of the item must be in accordance with prudential standards.

Report the principal amount of loans that are approved but not yet drawn. These are non-market related off-balance sheet contingent liabilities where the loans have been approved by the reporting party but the counterparty has yet to draw down the funds in relation to the arrangement.

The principal amount refers to the face value or gross amount of a given off-balance sheet transaction and not the fair value. The principal amount must be reported as a positive value, even for short positions in derivative financial instruments.
