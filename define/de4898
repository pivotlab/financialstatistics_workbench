## definition
Report the face value, or gross amount, of sold protection credit derivative contracts held by the reporting party as at the relevant date. This item is to be determined in accordance with the relevant accounting standards and ADI Guidance Notes where applicable.

Sold protection credit derivatives enable users to transfer the credit risk of an underlying asset from one party, the protection buyer, to another, the protection seller, in isolation from other risks.

Derivatives are generally defined as those instruments/contracts, where the value is based on other products, and/or on prices associated with financial products. Derivative contracts involve:
- Future delivery, receipt or exchange of financial items such as cash or another derivative instrument; or
- Future exchange of real assets for financial items where the contract may be tradeable and has a market value.
The contracts can either be binding on both parties (e.g. as with a currency swap) or subject to the exercise by one party of a right contained within the contract (as with options).

Report this item regardless of whether favourable or unfavourable to the reporting entity ie where it represents either a net gain or net loss to the entity across all open positions.

The principal amount must be reported as a positive value, even for short positions in derivative financial instruments.
