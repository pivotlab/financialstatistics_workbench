## definition
Report the increase in, or where applicable, the acquisition cost of, cash and liquid assets, during the relevant period.

For the purposes of this item, only report those amounts acquired, or initially recognised, during the relevant period. Where an asset is an amount held in a bank account, the value reported is the net of all movements in the account over the relevant period, but only where this net movement represents a net increase in the account's balance.

Assets are to be determined in accordance with relevant accounting standards.

The acquisition cost, or historical cost, of an asset is the original cost paid to acquire the asset, at the date the asset was initially acquired. Where the asset was acquired in stages, sum the initial acquisition cost of each stage, but only to the extent the acquisitions occurred during the relevant period.
