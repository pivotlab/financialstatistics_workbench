## definition
Report the net market value, or fair value, of exposures classified as receivables.

Receivables represent claims against customers and others for money, goods or services, arising during the ordinary course of business.

An exposure represents a claim or commitment of an entity, recorded both on and off the balance sheet and which can be of the following in nature:
(a) Credit exposures (i.e. such as a money market placement with a Bank or holding of a corporation's debt securities);
(b) Asset exposures that are not in the nature of a credit exposure (e.g. a direct property investment); and
(c) Exposures in the nature of a liability or obligation to a single party or group of related parties.
An off-balance sheet exposure refers to an item that is not recognised in the statement of financial position, such as contingent assets and liabilities.

Net market value, or fair value, is the amount which could be expected to be received from the disposal of an asset in an orderly market; or in an arm's length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties; after deducting costs expected to be incurred in realising the proceeds of such a disposal.
