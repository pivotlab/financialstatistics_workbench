## definition
This is the value of the reporting party's actual exposure to residential commercial property, which should include:
     - claims and commitments recorded on-balance sheet; and
     - the credit equivalent amounts of off-balance sheet claims and commitments.
     
Commercial property exposure is defined according to the nature of the risk. An exposure should be classified as commercial property risk, if the exposure is subject to the performance of the property market.
     
For reporting purposes, an exposure exists when a facility has been provided for the development, acquisition or improvement of residential buildings, and the servicing and repayment of the facility is dependent on the cash flows generated by the commercial residential property itself through sale or rental income, and/or from cash flows generated from other commercial residential properties owned by the borrower.
     
Commercial residential property exposure is that related to property used for housing but not for owner occupied housing or loans to households for investment residential property.
