## definition
This is the value, as at the relevant date, of the outstanding claims liability (OCL), gross of any recoveries, determined in accordance with relevant reporting standards.

The OCL relates to all claims incurred prior to the valuation date, whether or not they have been reported to the reporting party. The value of the OCL must include an amount in respect of the expenses that the reporting party expects to incur in settling these claims. The value of OCL must not include any Government charges directly imposed on the reporting party such as levies, duties and taxes, but must be gross of input tax credit recoveries.

The OCL will be measured as the present value of the future expected payments, i.e. discounted for future investment income, plus a risk margin determined in accordance with relevant reporting standards.
