## definition
This is the value, as at the relevant date, of commodity contracts (other than precious metal contracts), consistent with the classification and measurement basis used for derivatives by institutions in accordance with accounting standards.

A commodity contract is any contract that transfers the commodity price risk of an underlying commodity from one party to another. For the purposes of this item do not include precious metal contracts.

Derivatives are generally defined as those instruments/contracts, where the value is based on other products, and/or on prices associated with financial products. Derivative contracts involve:
- Future delivery, receipt or exchange of financial items such as cash or another derivative instrument; or
- Future exchange of real assets for financial items where the contract may be tradeable and has a market value.
The contracts can either be binding on both parties (e.g. as with a currency swap) or subject to the exercise by one party of a right contained within the contract (as with options).

Report this item regardless of whether favourable or unfavourable to the reporting entity.
