# Profit Or Loss Investment Insurance Policies Amount

## identifier
de1992

## type
float

## definition
This is the value, during the relevant period, for  realised gains/losses associated with the investments in insurance or life policies. Include:
- The change in net market value of unit-linked insurance or investment policies; and
- The change in net market value of policies in respect of death, total, permanent or temporary disablement.

Important:
If the superannuation entity invests in statutory funds of a life insurer and does not know the realised gains and losses, the superannuation entity should only account for the total change in net market value.
An estimate can be provided to calculate realised and unrealised gains and losses on a pro rata basis.
