## definition
This is the value of the High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) Adjusted Liability Base determined in accordance with prudential standards.
     
This is calculated as the Total Liabilities plus Shareholders Equity as determined in accordance with accounting standards; less the Eligible Capital Base; plus Off Balance Sheet Irrevocable Commitments.
     
The Eligible Capital Base is comprised of the Total Capital Base as determined in accordance with prudential standards; less the value of Adjusted HQLA Placements.
     
Adjusted HQLA Placements are calculated as follows:     
If the total deposits placed with the reporting party by other Approved Deposit-taking Institutions (ADIs) exceed the amount of total deposits the reporting party has placed with ADIs, then this amount is the total deposits the reporting party has placed with other ADIs (i.e. deposit assets), otherwise it is the total deposits placed with the reporting party (i.e. deposit liabilities) by other ADIs.
     
Off Balance Sheet Irrevocable Commitments comprise the following:
     - the value, as at the relevant date, of any potential credit exposures arising from direct credit substitutes, which are irrevocable off-balance sheet obligations that carry the same credit risk as a direct extension of credit, such as an undertaking to make a payment to a third party in the event that a counterparty fails to meet a financial obligation;
     -  the value, as at the relevant date, of any potential credit exposures arising from trade-related contingencies, which are contingent liabilities arising from a trade-related obligation that is secured against an underlying shipment of goods for both issuing and confirming parties;
     - the value, as at the relevant date, of any potential credit exposures arising from performance-related contingencies, which represent contingent liabilities involving an irrevocable obligation to pay a third party in the event that a counterparty fails to fulfil or perform a contractual non-monetary obligation, such as delivery of goods by a specified date, (i.e. the risk of loss depends on a future event that is not directly related to the creditworthiness of the counterparty involved);
     - the value, as at the relevant date, of any potential credit exposures arising from sale and repurchase agreements ('Repos'), which represent arrangements whereby an entity sells a loan, security or other asset to another party with a commitment to repurchase the asset at an agreed price on an agreed future date;
     - the value, as at the relevant date, of any potential credit exposures arising from assets sold with recourse, being asset sales (to the extent that such assets are not included on-balance sheet) by an entity where the holder of the asset is entitled to 'put' the asset back to the entity within an agreed period or under certain prescribed circumstances (e.g. deterioration in the value or credit quality of the asset concerned);
     - the value, as at the relevant date, of any potential credit exposures arising from forward asset purchases deemed non-market-related off-balance sheet transactions. These are commitments to purchase at a specified future date, and on pre-arranged terms, a loan, security or other asset from another entity, including written put options on specified assets with the character of a credit enhancement;
     - the value, as at the relevant date, of undrawn irrevocable commitments in the form of formal standby facilities and credit lines to the reporting party's customers and APRA industry support arrangements only. This represents the maximum unused portion of the commitment that could be drawn during the remaining period to maturity. This does not include standby facilities in place to support the reporting party's operations;
     - the value, as at the relevant date, of overdraft facilities available to the reporting party; and
     - the value, as at the relevant date, of undrawn irrevocable non-market-related commitments available for redraw under redraw facilities, but which are not certain of drawdown. This represents the maximum unused portion of the commitment that could be drawn during the remaining period to maturity but not does include amounts related to revolving credit facilities.
