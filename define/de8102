# Financial Risk Market Scaling Factor Volatility Number

## identifier

## type

## definition
This is the scaling factor applicable for positions which are sensitive to volatility changes, as determined in accordance with relevant prudential standards.

Volatility represents a measure of risk based on the standard deviation of the asset return. Volatility is a variable that appears in option pricing formulas, where it denotes the volatility of the underlying asset return from now to the expiration of the option.

The scaling factor consists of a multiplication factor and a plus factor, as determined in accordance with relevant prudential standards. The multiplication factor is set for each reporting party by APRA, and is subject to a minimum of three. A plus factor may also be required by APRA. This factor relates directly to back-testing results from the most recent 250 trading days prior to the relevant date.

Back-testing represents the process of comparing the daily trading outcome (profit or loss) with the corresponding VaR number for that day.
