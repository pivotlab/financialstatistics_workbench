# Assets Off Balance Sheet Undrawn Commitments Timing Known Amount

## identifier
de8217

## type
float

## definition
This is the value, as at the relevant date, of all undrawn (off-balance sheet) lending commitments, where timing of the interest rate repricing is known. This represents the maximum unused portion of the commitment that could be drawn during the remaining period to maturity. Any drawn portion of a commitment forms part of an entity's on-balance sheet exposure and is not to be reported at this item.

For the purposes of this item, commitments where no interest rate has been locked in should not be reported.

Commitments are generally considered to have arisen once the reporting party makes a firm offer to a client (i.e. customer acceptance is not required). Therefore, a commitment will arise once a letter of offer is provided to the client by the reporting party.
