## definition
This is the value, as at the relevant date, of credit exposures (on and off-balance sheet) excluding those related to revolving facilities with early amortisation provisions.

Revolving facility exposures are exposures arising from redrawable facilities, other than exposures in the nature of redrawable home loans where the amounts likely to be redrawn are expected to be immaterial relative to the size of the pool. Revolving facilities are excluded from this item where the reporting party transfers a pool of revolving exposures into a securitisation that contains an early amortisation provision.

A credit exposure represents an asset, liability, claim or commitment of an entity, which may be recorded on or off the balance sheet and which gives rise to credit risk.

Only report 50% of the resulting amount at this item.
