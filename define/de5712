## definition
Report the net value of all acquisition and disposal transactions of investment property. These transactions involve the exchange of valuable consideration between counterparties. Where this results in a net decrease in the net market value of assets, then report a negative figure.

For prudential reporting purposes a property investment exists where the investment (earnings and capital value) are dependent on the cash flows generated by the property through sale or rental income. 

Include: 
- Property investments acquired as part of the internal investment management of the reporting party; and 
- Underlying property investments held in the form of an external individually managed mandate/portfolio or discretely managed portfolio. 
Exclude: 
- Direct investments in property trusts (both listed and unlisted).
