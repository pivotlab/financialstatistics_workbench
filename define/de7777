# Financial Risk Credit Credit Exposures Category Two Facilities Amount

## definition
This is the outstanding balance of accounts at the relevant date classified by the reporting party as Category Two facilities, being an exposure that is secured by a registered first mortgage against a residential property, where the ratio of the outstanding balance, less the amount of mortgage insurance, to the valuation of the security is greater than 80 per cent but no more than 100 per cent (where the loan is 6 months or more worth of payments past due, the valuation must be no older than 12 months).

Outstanding balances should be reported net of interest and other income not taken to profit, and net of any amounts written off. For overdraft facilities and revolving lines of credit, the outstanding balance is to be reported as the total amount of the facility outstanding, and not the amount that the facility exceeds the previously approved limit. For overdrawn savings accounts, the outstanding balance represents the debit balance of the account. The balance outstanding should not be adjusted for any collateral value.
