## definition
This is the balancing item in the list in which it is being used.

Report the face value, or gross amount, of other equity derivative contracts held by the reporting party as at the relevant date.

This balancing item represents the principal value of total equity derivative contracts less those equity derivative contracts which are defined as any of the following:
- Forwards;
- Swaps;
- Bought option positions; or
- Sold option positions;

Equity derivative contracts are contracts that at least partly transfers the equity risk on an underlying equity security from one party to another.

A derivative is a financial instrument that is derived from some other asset, index, value or other variable (known as the underlying). Derivatives allow risk about the price of the underlying asset to be transferred from one party to another.

Derivative contracts involve:
 - Future delivery, receipt or exchange of financial items such as cash or another derivative instrument; or
 - Future exchange of real assets for financial items where the contract may be tradeable and has a market value.
The contracts can either be binding on both parties (e.g. as with a currency swap) or subject to the exercise by one party of a right contained within the contract (as with options).

Report this item regardless of whether favourable or unfavourable to the reporting entity ie where it represents either a net gain or net loss to the entity across all open positions.

The principal amount must be reported as a positive value, even for short positions in derivative financial instruments.
