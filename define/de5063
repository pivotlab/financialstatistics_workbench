## definition
This item is the balancing item in the list in which it appears.

Report the net market value, or fair value, of short sold option positions the entity has exposure to.

This balancing item represents total written (sold) option positions less those written (sold) option positions which are classed as any of the following:
- Interest rate contracts;
- Foreign exchange and gold contracts; or
- Equity contracts.

A sold, or written, option position includes both put and call options that have been sold by an entity. It obliges the selling entity to buy or sell a specific amount of an underlying asset at a pre-agreed price, on or before a specific future date.

Derivatives are generally defined as those instruments/contracts, where the value is based on other products, and/or on prices associated with financial products. Derivative contracts involve:
- Future delivery, receipt or exchange of financial items such as cash or another derivative instrument; or
- Future exchange of real assets for financial items where the contract may be tradeable and has a market value.
The contracts can either be binding on both parties (e.g. as with a currency swap) or subject to the exercise by one party of a right contained within the contract (as with options).

Net market value, or fair value, is the amount which could be expected to be received from the disposal of an asset in an orderly market; or in an arm's length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties; after deducting costs expected to be incurred in realising the proceeds of such a disposal.
