Tourism and leisure property exposure is defined according to the nature of the risk. An exposure should be classified as tourism and leisure property risk, if the exposure is subject to the performance of the property market for tourism, leisure or hospitality.

Tourism & leisure commercial property may include for example, hotels, motels and lodgings, recreational and sporting facilities, hotel developments, time-share developments and other hospitality industries.
