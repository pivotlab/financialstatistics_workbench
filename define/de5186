## definition
Report the Prudential Capital requirement, being the greater of the Management Capital Reserve and the Prescribed Minimum Capital Amount as per Prudential Standards.

The Management Capital Reserve is determined in accordance with the management capital prudential standard, as the total Management Capital Requirement less the Total Liabilities of the General Fund.

The total Management Capital Requirement is the value of the minimum capital requirement determined in accordance with the management capital prudential standard and held outside the statutory funds to ensure that under a range of adverse operating circumstances the company would be expected to be in a position to meet its trading commitments and adequately service its policy owners.

The total liabilities are the net market value, or fair value, of liabilities including deferred acquisition costs arising in respect of policies. This method of disclosure differs from the Australian Accounting Standards.

General Fund refers to the management fund for a friendly society or the shareholders' fund for other life companies, and is distinct and separate from the statutory funds of the life company.
