## definition
This dimension categorises the reported information by the hedge fund asset class type. A hedge fund represents a collective investment that displays a combination of the following characteristics: (a) borrowing and leverage restrictions, which are typically included in collective-investment-schemes-related regulation, are not applied, may use high levels of leverage; (b) significant performance fees (often in the form of a percentage of profits) are paid to the manager in addition to an annual management fee; (c) investors are typically permitted to redeem their interests periodically (e.g. quarterly, semi-annually or annually); (d) significant 'own' funds are often invested by the managers; (e) derivatives are used, often for speculative purposes, and there is an ability to short sell securities; and (f) more diverse risks or complex underlying products are involved.
