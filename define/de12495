## definition
This is the value, as at the relevant date, for the average stressed Value at Risk (VaR) for positions giving rise to interest rate risk. This represents the average VaR, calculated over the most recent 60 trading days prior to and including the relevant date, multiplied by the scaling factor applicable.

Interest rate positions include both on and off-balance sheet exposures which are affected by changes in interest rates. This includes holdings of, or positions in:
     - debt securities, including non-convertible preference shares and other quasi-debt securities/instruments that behave like debt (convertible bonds are to be included as debt securities if they trade like debt securities, but not if they trade like equities);
     - forward transactions in foreign exchange, equities and commodities; and
     - options that are subject to a change in value following a change in interest rates.


Stressed VaR, like VaR is a technique used to estimate the likelihood of losses in a portfolio based on analysis of historical price movements and volatilities, over a specified observation period. For the stressed VaR however, the model inputs are calibrated to historical data from a one year observation period of significant market stress relevant to the portfolio being simulated.
