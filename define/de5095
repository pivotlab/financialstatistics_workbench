## definition
In reporting this item the reporting party is to follow the basis that is used for the preparation of the annual financial statements in accordance with the Australian accounting standards. Actuarial valuations and calculations used in deriving the value of the item must be in accordance with prudential standards.

Report the principal amount of note issuance and revolving underwriting facilities. These are non-market related off-balance sheet contingent liabilities in relation to arrangements whereby a borrower may draw down funds up to a prescribed limit over a predefined period by making repeated note issues to the market, and where, should the issue prove unable to be placed in the market, the unplaced amount is to be taken up or funds made available by the reporting entity being committed as an underwriter of the facility.

The principal amount refers to the face value or gross amount of a given off-balance sheet transaction and not the fair value. The principal amount must be reported as a positive value, even for short positions in derivative financial instruments.
