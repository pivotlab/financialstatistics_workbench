## definition
This is the value, as at the relevant date, of credit exposures (on and off-balance sheet), other than those arising from the following:
     - senior positions and eligible senior exposures to facilities; 
     - tranches backed by non-granular pools; or
     - those relating to revolving facilities.

A credit exposure represents an asset, liability, claim or commitment of an entity, which may be recorded on or off the balance sheet and which gives rise to credit risk.

Revolving facility exposures are those exposures arising from redrawable facilities, other than exposures in the nature of redrawable home loans where the amounts likely to be redrawn are expected to be immaterial relative to the size of the pool. Only exclude those revolving facility exposures where the reporting party has transferred a pool of the revolving exposures into a securitisation that contains an early amortisation provision.
