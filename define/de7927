## definition
This is a balancing item in the list in which it is being used.

This is the value, as at the relevant date, of any potential credit exposures arising from the issue of direct credit substitutes which are not classified as any of the following:
- Guarantees;
- Credit derivatives - sold protection in the banking book;
- Standby letters of credit; or
- Bill endorsements.

A direct credit substitute is any irrevocable off-balance sheet obligation that carries the same credit risk as a direct extension of credit, such as an undertaking to make a payment to a third party in the event that a counterparty fails to meet a financial obligation, or an undertaking to a counterparty to acquire a potential claim on another party in the event of default by that party, constitutes a direct credit substitute (i.e. the risk of loss depends on the creditworthiness of the counterparty or the party on that a potential claim is acquired).
