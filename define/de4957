## definition
Record the amount paid, during the relevant period, to settle off balance sheet exposures related to liabilities classified as investment fees.

Investment fees are typically amounts payable to an entity that arise as a result of investing activities undertaken.

The settlement of a liability takes place when all legal or constructive obligations are eliminated.

Off-balance sheet liability exposures relate to those liabilities or obligations that do not satisfy the recognition requirements of the relevant accounting standards and are therefore not recognised on the face of the balance sheet, or statement of financial position.
