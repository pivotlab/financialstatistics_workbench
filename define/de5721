## definition
Report the Credit Risk component of Capital Adequacy Resilience Reserve (RRCR), to be calculated as:
 RRCR    = (L' / A") x (DELTA ACRY + DELTA ACRD)

Where:
L'    =  Liabilities adjusted for the prescribed yield change in the discount rate used in their valuation, in accordance with the capital adequacy standard.

A"    =  Adjusted value of admissible assets (see below); 

DELTA ACRY       =  the value of the Credit Risk Yield Adjustment - an addition to the resilience reserves (see below) made in accordance with the capital adequacy standards; and

DELTA ACRD       =  the value of the Credit Risk Default Adjustment - an addition to the resilience reserves (see below) calculated using the prescribed Credit Risk Default factors as set out in the capital adequacy standards.

Adjusted value of admissible assets is the value of total admissible assets with resilience requirement adjusted for:
- Credit Risk Yield Changes;
- Prescribed Yield Changes (allowing for diversification factor);
- Adverse Exchange Movement factor; and
- Credit Risk Default factors
as determined in accordance with the capital adequacy standards.

Total admissible assets is the value of total assets as determined in accordance with the accounting standards less the value of those deemed to be inadmissible, as per the capital adequacy standard. 

The inadmissible assets are: 
a) defined benefit superannuation fund surpluses;
b) holdings in an associated or subsidiary entity which is a Financial Services entity;
c) non-realisable (in the context of the capital adequacy tests) intangible assets;
d) assets with too little diversification, are too illiquid or have too great an exposure to one obligor of low credit standing;
e) reinsurance assets which may not be fully recoverable in the context of the capital adequacy tests; and
f) amounts by which the recorded value of an asset exceeds its net realisable value.

The Capital Adequacy Resilience Reserve is determined as the additional amount that needs to be held before the happening of a prescribed set of changes in the economic environment ( as per the capital adequacy standard), such that after the changes the admissible assets of the reporting party are able to meet the policy owner and other liabilities of the statutory fund in an ongoing business context.
