## definition
Report the historical value of off-balance sheet exposures to trade and other receivables arising from the sale or exchange of goods and services to the entity's debtors, or from other non-investment activities.

For the purposes of this item, only report those amounts acquired, or initially recognised, during the relevant period.

Off-balance sheet asset exposures relate to those assets or rights that do not satisfy the recognition requirements of relevant accounting standards and are therefore not recognised on the face of the balance sheet, or statement of financial position, such as contingent assets, performance-related rights and guarantees.
