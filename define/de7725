## type

## definition
This is the value, as at the relevant date, of surplus provisions on non-defaulted exposures, determined using the internal ratings based (IRB) approach to credit risk. This amount is to be reported net of deferred tax assets associated with eligible collective provisions, and is limited to 0.6% of credit risk weighted assets (RWA) of the reporting party.

For non-defaulted exposures, when there is a surplus of total eligible provisions over the total expected loss (EL) amount, the difference is reported at this item (to a maximum of 0.6% of credit RWA) where the surplus provisions are eligible to be treated as General Reserve for Credit Losses (GRCL).

This item is calculated for capital adequacy purposes and is to be determined in accordance with relevant Prudential Standards.
