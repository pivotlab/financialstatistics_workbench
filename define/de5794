## definition
Report the value of admissible assets in the General Fund for which there is no resilience reserve requirement, as per the management capital prudential standard.

Mismatching of asset and liability exposures necessitates the provision of a reserve for adverse movements in the investment markets to the extent they will not be matched by a corresponding movement in the liabilities. Where the policy owner liabilities of the statutory fund move in harmony with the assets supporting them, the Resilience Reserve in respect of those liabilities can be zero. It is not necessary to hold resilience reserves for that part of an asset which is inadmissible nor the free assets (in excess of the solvency or capital adequacy Requirement) of the fund.

The inadmissible assets are: 
a) assets which have a value that is dependent upon the continuation of the business;
b) holdings in an associated or subsidiary entity which is a Financial Services entity;
c) non-realisable (in the context of the scenarios of adverse experience) intangible assets;
d) other assets not measured at fair value in the regulatory financial statements; and
e) the alignment necessary to ensure the remaining assets and the other liabilities are based on net market value.

General Fund refers to the management fund for a friendly society or the shareholders' fund for other life companies, and is distinct and separate from the statutory funds of the life company.
