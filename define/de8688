For reporting purposes, an exposure exists when a facility has been provided for the development, acquisition or improvement of office buildings, and the servicing and repayment of the facility is dependent on the cash flows generated by the office property itself through sale or rental income, and/or from cash flows generated from other office properties owned by the borrower.
