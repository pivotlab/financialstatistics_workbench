## identifier

## type
float

## definition
This is the value, as at the relevant date, of undrawn irrevocable non-market-related commitments available for redraw under redraw facilities, but which are not certain of drawdown. This represents the maximum unused portion of the commitment that could be drawn during the remaining period to maturity.

This item is reported for capital adequacy purposes and is to be determined in accordance with relevant prudential standards.

Commitments, for capital adequacy purposes, are generally considered to have arisen once the reporting party makes a firm offer to a client (i.e. customer acceptance is not required). Therefore, a commitment will arise once a letter of offer is provided to the client by the reporting party.

For the purposes of this item, do not report undrawn balances of revolving facilities.
