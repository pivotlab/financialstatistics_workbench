## definition
Report the basic capital requirements liabilities in accordance with the solvency standard.

This is the total liabilities for capital requirements purposes excluding other liabilities and is calculated as the greater of: 
a) the Current Termination Value of insurance policies as at the relevant date, as calculated by the solvency standard, adjusted for the effective amount of risk mitigation difference to be included as an offset or addition to this value; and
b) the greater of the Policy Liability value (as determined in accordance with the assumptions of the solvency standard) or the Minimum Termination Value (MTV) plus the value of the Expense Reserve. 

The Current Termination Value of a policy is either:
a) the amount that would be paid on the basis used in practice from time to time in the event of voluntary termination; or
b) where no amount would be paid, the discounted present value of the unexpired risks, future payments and/or contractual premium refunds.

Risk mitigation difference is the difference in the value of risk mitigation arrangements as per prudential standards (reinsurance and other similar risk mitigating arrangements and contracts, that while not legally reinsurance, have similar effects) and the value as reflected in the financial statements. 

MTV is the amount that a life insurer is obliged to pay to policyholders if they decided to voluntarily terminate their policies at the relevant date. The obligation might be contractual, statutory or a result of past practice. Calculated as the greater of: 
a) the lowest Termination Value that the reporting party is obliged to pay; and 
b) the amount calculated in accordance with the Surrender Value Standard.

The Expense Reserve is the component of the determination of the requirement under the solvency standard that reflects capital requirements arising from expense risks in a closed fund scenario.
