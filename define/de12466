## definition
This is the value, as at the relevant date, of the outstanding principal amount, gross of provisions form impairment and including accrued interest of securitised assets and assets involved in fundraising arrangements.

Securitised assets are loans and advances that have been sold to or originated into securitisation programs, by or on behalf of the reporting party, or by a third party to a securitisation program sponsored by the reporting party, as at the relevant date.

Loans and advances are those financial assets categorised as 'Loans and Receivables' in the accounting standards, other than 'Trade Receivables' and 'Cash'.

A securitisation program represents a structure (a special purpose vehicle, or SPV) where the cash flows from a pool (of assets, or interests in assets) are used to service obligations to creditors (typically holders of debt securities) who fund the SPV.
     
A SPV is a 'bankruptcy-remote entity' with operations limited to the acquisition and financing of specific assets. Usually a subsidiary entity with balance sheet and legal status that makes its obligations secure even if the parent company goes bankrupt."

Assets involved in fundraising arrangements are the value of collateral which provides an interest in or over assets of the ADI to the funding provider.
