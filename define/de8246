# Financial Risk Market Scaling Factor Foreign Exchange Positions Delta Number

## identifier
de8246

## type
float

## definition
This is the scaling factor applicable for positions which are sensitive to foreign exchange rate movements, assuming all other factors (e.g. foreign exchange rate volatility) remain equal.

Delta, in this context, represents the impact of underlying foreign exchange rate movements on the overall portfolio value.

The scaling factor consists of a multiplication factor and a plus factor, as determined in accordance with relevant prudential standards. The multiplication factor is set for each reporting party by APRA, and is subject to a minimum of three. A plus factor may also be required by APRA. This factor relates directly to back-testing results from the most recent 250 trading days prior to the relevant date.

Back-testing represents the process of comparing the daily trading outcome (profit or loss) with the corresponding VaR number for that day.
