## definition
This is the value of Bills of Exchange held by the reporting party as at the relevant date that have been accepted by parties other than an Approved Deposit-taking Institution  and endorsed as the first endorser by the reporting party.

A bill of exchange is an unconditional order drawn (issued) by one party, sent to another party (usually a bank) for acceptance and made out to, or to the order of, a third party, or to bearer.

Endorsement of a bill of exchange creates a contingent liability by the endorser to pay out the funds conditional on the bearer/holder demanding payment.
