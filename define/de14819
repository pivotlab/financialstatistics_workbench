## definition
The countercyclical capital buffer is an additional holding of Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital applied as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets, which can be imposed by the national authority to protect the banking sector from periods of excess credit growth. This may vary over time according to market conditions.

## guidance
Refer Prudential Standard APS 110 for further information. For an Authorised Deposit taking Institutions(ADI) with exposures in Australia only, the ADI-specific buffer is equal to the Australian jurisdictional countercyclical buffer.
