## definition
This is the value, as at the relevant date, of non-market-related off-balance sheet exposures, as determined in accordance with Prudential Standard APS 221.

This includes all contingencies and  commitments, whether revocable or not, which have been advised to the counterparty. Any potential chargeback exposures to the counterparty arising from credit card acquiring activities should also be included. Exclude internal limits that have not been formally advised to the counterparty or group of related counterparties and may be cancelled at the reporting party's discretion.

The value of all unused commitments to the counterparty (do not apply credit conversion factors or risk weightings to the value) is to be reported on a net basis, i.e. net of exposures excluded under APS 221, specifically:
      - exposures deducted from the ADI's capital (refer APS 111);
     - exposures to the extent that they are secured by cash deposits (subject to satisfying the criteria in APS 112);
     - exposures to the extent that they are guaranteed by, or secured against securities issued by, governments or central banks (subject to satisfying the conditions in APS 112); 
     - exposures arising in the course of settlement of market-related contracts;
     - exposures to an ADI required as part of a liquidity support arrangement that has been certified by APRA under section 11CB of the Banking Act 1959; and 
     - exposures to the extent that they have been written off or specifically provided for.

Exposures arising from repos (i.e. sale and repurchase agreements) and reverse repos (i.e. purchase and resale agreements) of securities should be reported as exposures to the issuer of the securities and collateralised loans to the counterparty respectively.

Off-balance sheet refers to assets or liabilities that are not recognised or recorded on the statement of financial position of the reporting party because they do not satisfy the asset or liability accounting recognition requirements.
