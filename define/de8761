Inwards risk transfers are the value of cross border claims in which the risk has been reallocated from an immediate counterparty that is not the ECB to the ECB, by way of guarantees, collateral and banking book credit derivatives.
                                                                                                                                                               
Outwards risk transfers are the value of cross border claims in which the risk has been reallocated from the ECB to a counterparty that is not the ECB, by way of guarantees, collateral and banking book credit derivatives.
                                                                                                                  
The immediate counterparty is the one from whom the reporting party directly derives its return on investment in the financial asset and on whom the reporting party has the primary claim when liquidating the asset.
                                                                                                                                      
Cross border claims are those financial assets where the counterparty to the transaction meets the following criteria:
      - they are not a resident of the country in which the business unit that holds the claim is resident; or
      - they are a resident of the same country as the business unit that holds the claim but the claim is in a currency other than the official currency of that country.        
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
A financial asset consists of money or a claim against another person or business (the counterparty) that can be converted into money.
