(a) an exposure that is secured by a registered first mortgage against a residential property and is insured by an eligible lenders mortgage insurer for 100 per cent of the outstanding balance;
(b) an exposure that is secured by a registered first mortgage against a residential property, where the ratio of the outstanding balance, less the amount of mortgage insurance, to the valuation of the security is no more than 80 per cent (where the exposure is 6 months or more worth of payments past due, the valuation must be no older than 12 months); and
(c) an exposure that is secured by a qualifying registered second mortgage where:
(i) the ratio of the outstanding balances of the facilities secured by both first and second mortgages to the valuation of the residential property does not exceed 80 per cent, and the first mortgage cannot be extended without it being subordinated to the second mortgage; or
(ii) where the ratio of the outstanding balances of the facilities secured by both first and second mortgages to the valuation of the residential property exceeds 80 per cent, and the first mortgage cannot be extended without it being subordinated to the second mortgage, and the outstanding balance is 100 per cent mortgage insured by an eligible lenders mortgage insurer.

Outstanding balances should be reported net of interest and other income not taken to profit, and net of any amounts written off. For overdraft facilities and revolving lines of credit, the outstanding balance is to be reported as the total amount of the facility outstanding, and not the amount that the facility exceeds the previously approved limit. For overdrawn savings accounts, the outstanding balance represents the debit balance of the account.
