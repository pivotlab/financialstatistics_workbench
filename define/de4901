## definition
Report the undrawn balance of standby facilities that can be drawn down (funds accessed) within two to five days after notice is given by the reporting party of its intention to draw down on the standby facility (i.e. a two-five day waiting period).

In reporting this item the reporting party is to follow the basis that is used for the preparation of the annual financial statements in accordance with the Australian accounting standards. Actuarial valuations and calculations used in deriving the value of the item must be in accordance with prudential standards.

A formal standby facility or credit line is a formalised arrangement in which the counterparty has the right but not the obligation to draw down funds to a specified limit.

The undrawn balance is the balance of the facility that has not been used or drawn down by the reporting party at the relevant date.
