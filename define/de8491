This is a balancing item in the list in which it is being used.

This is the value, for the duration of the relevant period, of any other underwriting expenses, as required on APRA form GRF 310 0. This item is determined in accordance with the relevant Accounting Standards.

Other underwriting expenses excludes:
- acquisition costs and the results of liability adequacy tests;
- levies and charges; and
- commission expense.

Acquisition costs are incurred in obtaining and recording insurance contracts. They include commission or brokerage paid to agent or brokers for obtaining business for the insurer, selling and underwriting costs such as advertising and risk assessment, the administrative costs of recording policy information and premium collection costs.

Liability adequacy test means an assessment of whether the carrying amount of an insurance liability needs to be increased (or the carrying amount of the related deferred acquisition costs or related intangible assets decreased) based on a review of future cash flows.
