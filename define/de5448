## definition
Report the net of acquisition costs incurred and disposal proceeds received, or receivable, on the acquisition and disposal of asset exposures during the relevant period. For the purposes of this item, exclude exposures arising from contribution revenue. Where an asset exposure is an amount held in a bank account, the value reported is the net of all movements in the account over the relevant period.

An asset exposure represents those assets or rights of an entity, recorded both on and off the balance sheet. 

An on-balance sheet exposure relates to those assets or rights recognised on the face of the balance sheet, or statement of financial position. An off-balance sheet exposure relates to those assets or rights that are not recognised on the face of the balance sheet, or statement of financial position, such as contingent assets, performance-related rights and guarantees.

Assets are to be determined in accordance with relevant accounting standards.

The acquisition cost, or historical cost, of an asset is the original cost paid to acquire the asset, at the date the asset was initially acquired. Where the asset was acquired in stages, sum the initial acquisition cost of each stage, but only to the extent the acquisitions occurred during the relevant period.

The disposal of an asset represents a change in ownership of that asset, whether because of some act or event, or by operation of law. Proceeds are calculated as the total consideration received, or receivable, by the reporting party arising from the change in ownership of that asset, but only to the extent the change occured during the relevant period.
