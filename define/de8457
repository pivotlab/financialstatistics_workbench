## definition
This is the value, as at the relevant date, of equity derivative contracts in relation to off-balance sheet exposures of the reporting party, or on-balance sheet liabilities not classified as claims liabilities or debt funding/borrowing. 

An equity contract is any contract that at least partly transfers the equity risk of an underlying equity security from one party to another.

Derivatives are generally defined as those instruments/contracts, where the value is based on other products, and/or on prices associated with financial products. Derivative contracts involve:
- Future delivery, receipt or exchange of financial items such as cash or another derivative instrument; or
- Future exchange of real assets for financial items where the contract may be tradeable and has a market value.
The contracts can either be binding on both parties (e.g. as with a currency swap) or subject to the exercise by one party of a right contained within the contract (as with options).

Report this item regardless of whether favourable or unfavourable to the reporting entity.
