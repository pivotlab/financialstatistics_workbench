## definition
This is, for the duration of the relevant period, unrealised gains or (losses) recognised on equity securities.

Unrealised gains/losses
The change in the net market value is the increase or decrease in the market value of each asset compared to the value of that asset at the beginning of the relevant period. These assets are still owned by the entity at the end of the period, they have not been disposed of, and as a result, the gains or losses on the assets are unrealised. If the assets are disposed of during the period, then the gains or losses are realised.
Only include the movement in the net market value of the asset. Do not include the movement in the value of the currency relative to the local currency if the asset is denominated in a currency other than the local currency.

Equity investments or securities are, as defined by the Australian Accounting Standards, contracts that evidence a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all its liabilities.
