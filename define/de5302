## definition
Report the inadmissible value of equity investment securities as per the solvency standard. 

Equity investment securities are, as defined by the Australian Accounting Standards, contracts that evidence a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all its liabilities, acquired with the intent to derive a gain either through an income stream or disposal.

The inadmissible assets are: 
a) holdings in an associated or subsidiary entity which is a Financial Services entity;
b) assets with too little diversification, are too illiquid or have too great an exposure to one obligor of low credit standing; and
c) amounts by which the recorded value of an asset exceeds its net realisable value.
