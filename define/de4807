## definition
Report the acquisition cost, or historical cost, of off-balance sheet exposures to investments classified as balanced or mixed mandates, and which are otherwise unable to be allocated across existing asset classes.

For the purposes of this item, only report those amounts acquired, or initially recognised, during the relevant period. Where an asset is an amount held in a bank account, the value reported is the net of all movements in the account over the relevant period, but only where this net movement represents a net increase in the account's balance.

Off-balance sheet asset exposures relate to those assets or rights that do not satisfy the recognition requirements of relevant accounting standards and are therefore not recognised on the face of the balance sheet, or statement of financial position, such as contingent assets, performance-related rights and guarantees.

The acquisition cost, or historical cost, of an asset is the original cost paid to acquire the asset, at the date the asset was initially acquired. Where the asset was acquired in stages, sum the initial acquisition cost of each stage, but only to the extent the acquisitions occurred during the relevant period.
