## definition
Report the value of the Credit Risk Yield Adjustment in relation to admissible assets with non-standard resilience factors, as per the capital adequacy standard.

The Credit Risk Yield Adjustment is an addition to the resilience reserves made in accordance with the capital adequacy standards. The Resilience Reserve is determined as the additional amount that needs to be held before the happening of a prescribed set of changes in the economic environment ( as per the capital adequacy standard), such that after the changes the admissible assets of the reporting party are able to meet the policy owner and other liabilities of the statutory fund, in an ongoing business context.

Admissible assets with non-standard resilience factors are those assets where the actuary has considered that non-standard resilience factors are appropriate. This should only be used in rare cases. It is intended to cover situations where assets are disaggregated into (1) an identifiable sub-asset and (2) a residual that does not fit into any of the asset sectors specified by Life Insurance Prudential Standards for resilience purposes, or where a non-standard resilience risk has been modelled in accordance with Life Insurance Prudential Standards.
