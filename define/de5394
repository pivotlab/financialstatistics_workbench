## definition
Report the value of the Adverse Exchange Movement Adjustment in relation to admissible Investment Property with resilience requirement, as per the solvency standard.

The Adverse Exchange Movement Adjustment is an addition to the resilience reserves calculated using the prescribed Adverse Exchange Movement factor as set out in the solvency standards. The Resilience Reserve is determined as the additional amount that needs to be held before the happening of a prescribed set of changes in the economic environment, such that after the changes the admissible assets of the reporting party are able to meet the policy owner and other liabilities of the statutory fund.

Admissible Investment Property is the net market value of the entity's holdings of property investments as determined in accordance with the relevant accounting standards, including accrued income, less the value of those deemed to be inadmissible, as per the solvency standard. This  includes investments in property by way of units in property trusts or other indirect investment methods as well as investments in real property (land and buildings).

The inadmissible assets are: 
a) assets which have a value that is dependent upon the continuation of the business;
b) holdings in an associated or subsidiary entity which is a Financial Services entity;
c) non-realisable (in the context of the solvency tests) intangible assets;
d) assets with too little diversification, are too illiquid or have too great an exposure to one obligor of low credit standing;
e) reinsurance assets which may not be fully recoverable in the context of the solvency tests; and
f) amounts by which the recorded value of an asset exceeds its net realisable value.
