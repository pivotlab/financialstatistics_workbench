## definition
Report the net market value, or fair value, of asset exposures, excluding contribution revenue received or receivable.

An asset exposure represents those assets or rights of an entity, recorded both on and off the balance sheet. 

An on-balance sheet exposure relates to those assets or rights recognised on the face of the balance sheet, or statement of financial position. An off-balance sheet exposure relates to those assets or rights that are not recognised on the face of the balance sheet, or statement of financial position, such as contingent assets, performance-related rights and guarantees.

Assets, as defined by the Australian Accounting Standards, are resources:
(a) controlled by an entity as a result of past events; and
(b) from which future economic benefits are expected to flow to the entity.

Net market value or fair value is the amount which could be expected to be received from the disposal of an asset in an orderly market; or in an arm's length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties; after deducting costs expected to be incurred in realising the proceeds of such a disposal.
