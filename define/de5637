# Financial Risk Solvency Inadmissible Assets Reinsurance Value Amount

## identifier

## type

## definition
Report the inadmissible portion of the value of reinsurance assets, as determined in accordance with the solvency standard, i.e. those with Associated and Subsidiary Financial Services Entities, and/or concentrated in a single reinsurer.

In applying the asset concentration limits of the Standard:
a) All exposures to a reinsurer or reinsurance group are to be considered a single counterparty exposure (within the practical context of the application of the limits concerned); and
b) Where arrangements with a reinsurer involve both liability and asset components, these may be taken as a single net exposure to the extent they are subject to a legally enforceable right of offset.
