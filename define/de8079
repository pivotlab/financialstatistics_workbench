## definition
This is the value, as at the relevant date, of uncovered, or naked, commodity (excluding gold) call options the entity purchased, as determined in accordance with relevant prudential standards.

For the purposes of this item, option positions which are partially covered should be reported only to the extent of their uncovered amount.

Uncovered, or naked, positions represent those positions which are not backed by underlying assets, and are generally entered into for speculative trading purposes.

A bought, or purchased, call option is a call option that has been purchased by an entity. It provides the purchasing entity with the right but not the obligation to buy a specific amount of the underlying asset at a pre-agreed price, on or before a specific future date.

A commodity contract is any contract that transfers the commodity price risk of an underlying commodity from one party to another.
