## definition
This is the value of goods financed, or to be financed, under operating leases, from new commitments provided by the reporting party during the relevant period, regardless of whether or not they have subsequently been withdrawn, or cancelled, during or after the period. This excludes commitments for commercial hire purchase agreements, for debt participation in leverages lease agreements, and for leveraged leases which are finance leases where the lessor provides a portion of the finance, with the major portion usually provided by long-term creditors and where the creditor's recourse to the lessor is restricted to the proceeds from disposal of the leased asset and any unremitted lease payments. 

Goods may be valued using one of the following methods:
     - the capital cost of new goods;
     - the written-down value of goods re-leased;
     - the purchase price of second-hand goods; or
     - in the case of revolving lease facilities, such as master leases, report the value of goods acquired at each drawdown against such facilities. Do not report the value of commitments to provide a leasing limit or to increase a leasing limit.

A commitment is a firm offer to provide finance which has been accepted by the client. A commitment generally exists once the loan application has been approved, and a loan contract or letter of offer has been issued to the borrower. 

An Operating Lease is a lease under which the lessor effectively retains substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased asset. This excludes hire purchase agreements; or commitments for, or for debt participation in, leveraged leases.
