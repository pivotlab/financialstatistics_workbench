## definition
This item is the balancing item in the list in which it appears.

Report the net market value, or fair value, of the net position of any other derivative contracts held by the reporting party as at the relevant date. The value of this item is to be determined in accordance with accounting standards.

This balancing item represents total derivative financial instruments less those derivative derivative financial instruments which are classed as any of the following:
- Interest rate contracts;
- Foreign exchange contracts; or
- Equity contracts;

A derivative is a financial instrument that is derived from some other asset, index, value or other variable (known as the underlying). Derivatives allow risk about the price of the underlying asset to be transferred from one party to another.

Derivative contracts involve:
 - Future delivery, receipt or exchange of financial items such as cash or another derivative instrument; or
 - Future exchange of real assets for financial items where the contract may be tradeable and has a market value.
The contracts can either be binding on both parties (e.g. as with a currency swap) or subject to the exercise by one party of a right contained within the contract (as with options).

Report this item regardless of whether favourable or unfavourable to the reporting entity ie where it represents either a net gain or net loss to the entity across all open positions.

Net market value, or fair value, is the amount which could be expected to be received from the disposal of an asset in an orderly market; or in an arm's length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties; after deducting costs expected to be incurred in realising the proceeds of such a disposal.
