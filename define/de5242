## definition
Record the benefit fund type of the reporting entity.

A fund can be classified as one, and only one, of the following benefit types:
A - Accumulation Benefit Funds;
B - Defined Benefit Funds - all members defined benefits; or
C - Defined Benefit Funds - not all members defined benefits.

An Accumulation Benefit Entity, or Defined Contribution Entity, is a fund where the benefit a member receives is the total of specifically defined contributions to the fund plus earnings on those contributions, minus expenses and tax. Members carry the investment risk with this style of fund.

A Defined Benefit Entity (all members defined benefits) is an entity where the formula for calculating the retirement benefit (and possibly other benefits also) is specified, usually in terms of years of service with the employer (or years of membership of the entity) and average salary level over the last few years prior to retirement. For example the formula may be that a member on retiring will receive 15 per cent of final average salary for each year of membership. The employer sponsor/contributor to a defined benefit entity carries the investment risk. 

A Defined Benefit Entity (not all members defined benefits) represents a fund which consists of a combination of both Accumulation (Defined Contribution) and Defined Benefit members. This is sometimes referred to as a 'hybrid' fund.
