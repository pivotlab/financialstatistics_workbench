## definition
This is a balancing item in the list in which it is being used.

This is the value, as at the relevant date, of capitalised expenses other than those already listed on ARF_110_0_1 and ARF_110_0_2 (where applicable). This includes capitalised expenses of a general nature, such as strategic business development initiatives, and other forms of transaction costs and like costs that are required to be deferred/capitalised and amortised in accordance with accounting standards.

This item is reported as a deduction from Tier 1 capital for capital adequacy purposes and is to be determined in accordance with the Banking Act 1959, relevant Prudential Standards and associated Guidance Notes.

The balance of any transaction costs and like items that are capitalised and deferred as an asset must be netted off against the balance of any income deferred as a liability relating to the products giving rise to the capitalised transaction costs (i.e. only deferred costs and income in particular product portfolios may be netted). 

Any positive net balance of capitalised transaction costs must be deducted from Tier 1 capital in accordance with the relevant Prudential Standard. Any surplus of up-front fee income received over deferred costs may be added to Tier 1 capital provided the up-front fee income received satisfies the criteria set under Prudential Standard APS 111. Otherwise, up-front fee income received must not be added to capital.
