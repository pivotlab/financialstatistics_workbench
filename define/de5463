## definition
Report the net market value, or fair value, of exposures classified as payables, or creditors, but excluding member benefits payables.

Payables represent claims on the entity by it's suppliers and others for money, arising from the provision of goods or services by the supplier during the ordinary course of business.

Member benefits represent those benefits arising from both accumulated/defined contributions plans and defined benefits plans. 

Under an accumulation/defined contributions plan, the entity's present obligation to pay benefits to members and beneficiaries in the future. It is calculated as the difference between the carrying amounts of the assets and the carrying amounts of the liabilities as at the relevant date. 

Under a defined benefits plan, accrued benefits of a defined benefit plan shall be measured, using actuarial assumptions and valuations where appropriate, as the present value of expected future payments to members arising from membership of the entity up to the measurement date. In absence of formal actuarial review, the amount is calculated as the difference between the carrying amounts of the assets and the carrying amounts of the liabilities as at the relevant date.

An exposure represents a claim or commitment of an entity, recorded both on and off the balance sheet and which can be the following in nature:
(a) Credit exposures (i.e. such as a money market placement with a Bank or holding of a corporation's debt securities);
(b) Asset exposures that are not in the nature of a credit exposure (e.g. a direct property investment); and
(c) Exposures in the nature of a liability or obligation to a single party or group of related parties.
An off-balance sheet exposure refers to an item that is not recognised in the statement of financial position, such as contingent assets and liabilities.

Net market value, or fair value, is the amount which could be expected to be received from the disposal of an asset in an orderly market; or in an arm's length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties; after deducting costs expected to be incurred in realising the proceeds of such a disposal.
