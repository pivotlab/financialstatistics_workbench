For reporting purposes, an exposure exists when a facility has been provided for the development, acquisition or improvement of commercial property, and the servicing and repayment of the facility is dependent on the cash flows generated by the property itself through sale or rental income, and/or from cash flows generated from other commercial properties owned by the borrower.
