## definition
The value to be reported is the net market value, or fair value, of specified loans classified as assets, plus income accrued but not received in relation to this asset. This method of disclosure differs from the Australian Accounting Standards.

Specified loans for reporting of this item are secured loans or loans to public sector entities.

Loans include but are not limited to financial leases and mortgages. Loans differ from interest bearing securities as usually the asset is non negotiable (i.e. able to be traded on a secondary market).

Net market value, or fair value, is the amount which could be expected to be received from the disposal of an asset in an orderly market; or in an arm's length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties; after deducting costs expected to be incurred in realising the proceeds of such a disposal.
