## definition
This is the value, as at the relevant date, of equity exposures and other capital investments held by the reporting party.

For the purposes of this item, exclude equity exposures and other capital investments where:

     (a) the equity exposure or other capital investment is held for trading purposes, in which case it is to be included in the reporting party's risk weighted assets (RWA).
     (b) the equity exposure is acquired through underwriting of a new equity instrument and the equity instrument is disposed of within 90 days of the date of issue. If the equity instrument is not disposed of within 90 days of issuance, it must be deducted in accordance with the relevant limits for equity exposures and other capital investments, unless the position forms part of the reporting party's trading book; or
     (c) the equity exposure or other capital investment is held under a legal agreement on behalf of:
          (i) at Level 1 - an external third party, even if held in the name of the reporting party; or
          (ii) at Level 2 - a party outside the Level 2 consolidated group, even if held in the name of the reporting party (or another member of its Level 2 consolidated group.).

Where a facility, including a guarantee, provided to a related party or a non-related party constitutes 'capital support', it must be treated as 'other capital investments'.

This item represents a 50/50 capital adequacy deduction, therefore only report 50 per cent of the asset amount at this item. This amount is to be deducted from both Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital.

This item is calculated for capital adequacy purposes and is to be determined in accordance with relevant Prudential Standards.
