## definition
This dimension categorises information reported under the internal ratings based approach to credit risk, based on the prescribed retail exposure classes, as determined in accordance with relevant prudential standards.

An exposure is categorised as a retail exposure if it is extended to an individual (that is, a natural person) or individuals and is part of a large pool of exposures that are managed by the ADI on a pooled basis and is not margin lending.
