## definition
Report the value of admissible Investment Property with resilience requirement at the adjusted yield, as per the capital adequacy standard.

The Adjusted Yield is determined in accordance with the capital adequacy standard and is applied to the value of the admissible assets as part of the calculation of the Resilience Reserve. The Resilience Reserve is determined as the additional amount that needs to be held before the happening of a prescribed set of changes in the economic environment ( as per the capital adequacy standard), such that after the changes the admissible assets of the reporting party are able to meet the policy owner and other liabilities of the statutory fund, in an ongoing business context.

Admissible Investment Property is the net market value of the entity's holdings of property investments as determined in accordance with the relevant accounting standards less the value of those deemed to be inadmissible, as per the capital adequacy standard. This  includes investments in property by way of units in property trusts or other indirect investment methods as well as investments in real property (land and buildings).

The inadmissible assets are: 
a) defined benefit superannuation fund surpluses;
b) holdings in an associated or subsidiary entity which is a Financial Services entity;
c) non-realisable (in the context of the capital adequacy tests) intangible assets;
d) assets with too little diversification, are too illiquid or have too great an exposure to one obligor of low credit standing;
e) reinsurance assets which may not be fully recoverable in the context of the capital adequacy tests; and
f) amounts by which the recorded value of an asset exceeds its net realisable value.
