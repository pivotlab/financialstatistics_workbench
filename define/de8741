## definition
This is the value of the reporting party's actual exposure to tourism and leisure commercial property, which should include:
     - claims and commitments recorded on-balance sheet; and
     - the credit equivalent amounts of off-balance sheet claims and commitments.
     
Commercial property exposure is defined according to the nature of the risk. An exposure should be classified as commercial property risk, if the exposure is subject to the performance of the property market.
     
For reporting purposes, an exposure exists when a facility has been provided for the development, acquisition or improvement of land and buildings used in the tourism and leisure or hospitality industries, and the servicing and repayment of the facility is dependent on the cash flows generated by the property itself through sale or rental income, and/or from cash flows generated from other tourism and leisure properties owned by the borrower.

Tourism & leisure commercial property may include for example, hotels, motels and lodgings, recreational and sporting facilities, hotel developments, time-share developments and other hospitality industries.
