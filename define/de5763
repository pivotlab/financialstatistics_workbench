## definition
Report the net value of all incurrance and settlement transactions, during the relevant period, of off balance sheet exposures related to liabilities classified as trustee fees payable.

Trustee fees are typically amounts payable to the trustee for performing their legal responsibilities as detailed in the Trust Deed.

Off-balance sheet liability exposures relate to those liabilities or obligations that do not satisfy the recognition requirements of the relevant accounting standards and are therefore not recognised on the face of the balance sheet, or statement of financial position.
