## definition
This is the value, as at the relevant date, of guarantees and credit derivatives that provide for a materiality threshold and where the is an equivalent to retained first loss positions.

Equivalents to retained first loss positions arise:
     (a) where credit protection provides for a materiality threshold on payments below which no payment will be made in the event of loss.; and
     (b) in the context of securitisation, where there is partial coverage of an underlying exposure by a credit derivative, there is a difference in seniority between protected and unprotected tranches, and the credit derivative contract contains a materiality threshold.

This amount is capped at the amount of capital the reporting party would be required to hold against the full value of the exposure or underlying expose, as appropriate.

This item represents a 50/50 capital adequacy deduction, therefore only report 50 per cent of the asset amount at this item. This amount is to be deducted from both Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital.

This item is calculated for capital adequacy purposes and is to be determined in accordance with relevant Prudential Standards.
