## definition
This is a balancing item in the list in which it is being used.

This is the value, as at the relevant date, of other derivative contracts, consistent with the classification and measurement basis used for derivatives by institutions in accordance with accounting standards.

This balancing item represents total derivative contracts, less those which are classified as any of the following:
     - Interest Rate Swaps;
     - Interest Rate Option Contracts;
     - Interest Rate Futures and Forwards Contracts; and
     - Foreign Exchange Derivative Contracts.

Derivatives are generally defined as those instruments/contracts, where the value is based on other products, and/or on prices associated with financial products. Derivative contracts involve:
- Future delivery, receipt or exchange of financial items such as cash or another derivative instrument; or
- Future exchange of real assets for financial items where the contract may be tradeable and has a market value.
The contracts can either be binding on both parties (e.g. as with a currency swap) or subject to the exercise by one party of a right contained within the contract (as with options).

Report this item regardless of whether favourable or unfavourable to the reporting entity.
