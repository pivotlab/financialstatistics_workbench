# Assets Loans And Receivables Insurance Recoveries Not Reinsurance Outstanding Claims Liability Central Estimate Amount

## identifier
de12997

## type
float

## definition
This is the value, as at the relevant date, of the central estimate of recoveries, other than reinsurance recoveries, receivable by the reporting entity in relation to outstanding (unpaid) claims. This item is to be determined in accordance with relevant prudential standards. Recoveries to be included at this item include salvage, subrogation, and input tax credit recoveries, amongst others.

The central estimate will be measured as the present value of the future expected recoveries except from reinsurance, i.e. discounted for future investment income, determined in accordance with relevant prudential standards. The central estimate is intended to reflect the mean value in the range of possible values for the outcome (that is, the mean of the distribution of probabilistic outcomes), and so does not include any risk margin.
