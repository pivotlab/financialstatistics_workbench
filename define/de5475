- Adverse Exchange Movement factor; and
- Credit Risk Default factors
as determined in accordance with the solvency standards.

Admissible other non-investment assets is the value of the total assets acquired without the intent to derive a gain either through an income stream or disposal, other than those categorised elsewhere, less the value of those deemed to be inadmissible, as per the solvency standard. 

The inadmissible assets are: 
a) assets which have a value that is dependent upon the continuation of the business;
b) holdings in an associated or subsidiary entity which is a Financial Services entity;
c) non-realisable (in the context of the solvency tests) intangible assets;
d) assets with too little diversification, are too illiquid or have too great an exposure to one obligor of low credit standing;
e) reinsurance assets which may not be fully recoverable in the context of the solvency tests; and
f) amounts by which the recorded value of an asset exceeds its net realisable value.
