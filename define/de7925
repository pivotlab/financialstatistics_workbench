## definition
This is the value, as at the relevant date, of standby letters of credit on issue that are serving as financial guarantees for loans, securities and any other financial liabilities. Report only standby letters of credit that constitute direct credit substitutes.
     
A direct credit substitute is any irrevocable off-balance sheet obligation that carries the same credit risk as a direct extension of credit, such as an undertaking to make a payment to a third party in the event that a counterparty fails to meet a financial obligation, or an undertaking to a counterparty to acquire a potential claim on another party in the event of default by that party (i.e. the risk of loss depends on the creditworthiness of the counterparty or the party on that a potential claim is acquired).
