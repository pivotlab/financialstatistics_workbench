## definition
Report the net value of all acquisition and disposal transactions of off balance sheet exposures related to assets classified as investment property. These transactions involve the exchange of valuable consideration between counterparties. Where this results in a net decrease in the net market value of assets, then report a negative figure.

For prudential reporting purposes a property investment exists where the investment (earnings and capital value) are dependent on the cash flows generated by the property through sale or rental income. 

Include: 
- Property investments acquired as part of the internal investment management of the reporting party; and 
- Underlying property investments held in the form of an external individually managed mandate/portfolio or discretely managed portfolio. 
Exclude: 
- Direct investments in property trusts (both listed and unlisted).

The acquisition cost, or historical cost, of an asset is the original cost paid to acquire the asset, at the date the asset was initially acquired. Where the asset was acquired in stages, sum the initial acquisition cost of each stage, but only to the extent the acquisitions occurred during the relevant period.

The disposal of an asset takes place if a change of ownership occurs, whether because of some act or event (such as damage) or by operation of law, e.g. when an asset is transferred from one person to another by way of sale or gift.

Off-balance sheet asset exposures relate to those assets or rights that do not satisfy the recognition requirements of the relevant accounting standards and are therefore not recognised on the face of the balance sheet, or statement of financial position, such as contingent assets, performance-related rights and guarantees.
