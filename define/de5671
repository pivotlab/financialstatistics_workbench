## definition
In reporting this item the reporting party is to follow the basis that is used for the preparation of the annual financial statements in accordance with the Australian accounting standards. Actuarial valuations and calculations used in deriving the value of the item must be in accordance with prudential standards.

Report the principal amount of sale and repurchase agreements ('Repos'). This relates to non-market related off-balance sheet arrangements whereby an entity sells a loan, security or other asset to another party with a commitment to repurchase the asset at an agreed price on an agreed future date.

The principal amount refers to the face value or gross amount of a given off-balance sheet transaction and not the fair value. The principal amount must be reported as a positive value, even for short positions in derivative financial instruments.
