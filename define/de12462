## definition
This is the value, as at the relevant date, of the securitisation special purpose vehicles (SPVs) or secured funding arrangements to which the reporting entity has provided new lending facilities during the reporting period.

An SPV is a financing vehicle that typically purchases and holds the pool for the purposes of a securitisation. The SPV's payment for the pool is typically funded by debt, including through the issue of units or securities by the SPV.

Lending facilities are loan agreements entered into for the purpose of providing loans directly to investors to invest in securitisation programs.
