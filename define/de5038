This item is the balancing item in the list in which it appears.

Report the net market value, or fair value, of all other derivative financial instruments held by the reporting party as at the relevant date. The value of this item is to be determined in accordance with accounting standards.

This balancing item represents total derivatives less those derivatives which are excluded below:

Exclude those types of derivative financial instruments defined as:
- Forwards;
- Swaps

Derivatives are generally defined as those instruments/contracts, where the value is based on other products, and/or on prices associated with financial products. Derivative contracts involve:
- Future delivery, receipt or exchange of financial items such as cash or another derivative instrument; or
- Future exchange of real assets for financial items where the contract may be tradeable and has a market value.
The contracts can either be binding on both parties (e.g. as with a currency swap) or subject to the exercise by one party of a right contained within the contract (as with options).

Report this item regardless of whether favourable or unfavourable to the reporting entity ie where it represents either a net gain or net loss to the entity across all open positions.

Net market value, or fair value, is the amount which could be expected to be received from the disposal of an asset in an orderly market; or in an arm's length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties; after deducting costs expected to be incurred in realising the proceeds of such a disposal.
