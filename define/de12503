## definition
This is, as at the relevant date, the scaling factor for the stressed Value at Risk (VaR) applicable, for positions giving rise to market risk.

Stressed VaR, like VaR is a technique used to estimate the likelihood of losses in a portfolio based on analysis of historical price movements and volatilities, over a specified observation period. For the stressed VaR however, the model inputs are calibrated to historical data from a one year observation period of significant market stress relevant to the portfolio being simulated.

The scaling factor consists of a multiplication factor and a plus factor, as determined in accordance with relevant prudential standards. The multiplication factor is set for each reporting party by APRA, and is subject to a minimum of three. A plus factor may also be required by APRA. This factor relates directly to back-testing results from the most recent 250 trading days prior to the relevant date.

Equity positions include on and off-balance sheet exposures which are affected by changes in Equity prices. This includes holdings of, or positions in:
     - ordinary shares, whether voting or non-voting;
     - convertible securities that behave like equities;
     - commitments to buy or sell equity securities; and
     - any other instruments that exhibit market behaviour similar to equities.

Back-testing represents the process of comparing the daily trading outcome (profit or loss) with the corresponding stressed VaR number for that day.
