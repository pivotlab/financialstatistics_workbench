## identifier

## type
float

## definition
This is the value, as at the relevant date, of the central estimate of recoveries, other than reinsurance recoveries, receivable by the reporting entity associated with the premiums liabilities. This item is to be determined in accordance with relevant prudential standards. 

The central estimate will be measured as the present value of the future expected recoveries except from reinsurance, i.e. discounted for future investment income, determined in accordance with relevant prudential standards. The central estimate is intended to reflect the mean value in the range of possible values for the outcome (that is, the mean of the distribution of probabilistic outcomes), and so does not include any risk margin.
