## definition
This is the value, during the relevant period, of realised and unrealised foreign exchange gains (losses) relating to derivatives over hedged borrowings. This item is in accordance with the relevant accounting standards.

Derivatives are generally defined as those instruments/contracts, where the value is based on other products, and/or on prices associated with financial products. Derivative contracts involve:
- Future delivery, receipt or exchange of financial items such as cash or another derivative instrument; or
- Future exchange of real assets for financial items where the contract may be tradeable and has a market value.
The contracts can either be binding on both parties (e.g. as with a currency swap) or subject to the exercise by one party of a right contained within the contract (as with options).

Gains (losses) are realised where the entity disposed of an asset during the relevant period. If an asset has not been disposed of during the relevant period, then any increases or decreases in the fair value of the asset are recognised as unrealised gains (losses).
