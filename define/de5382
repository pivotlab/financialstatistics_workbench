## definition
Report the net market value or fair value, of the net position of derivative contracts classified as equity warrants, consistent with the classification and measurement basis used for derivatives by institutions in accordance with accounting standards. 

An equity warrant is a warrant issued over equity securities (for example, shares in companies). It provides the equity warrant holder with the right to buy or sell the equity securities at a pre-agreed price on or before a specific future date.

A warrant is an option issued in the form of a security, usually written for a longer term. A warrant has the same function as a call option: it provides the right to buy a specific amount of the underlying securities or shares, but is itself tradeable. The main difference between warrants and call options is that warrants are issued and guaranteed by the company, whereas options are exchange instruments and are not issued by the company.

Derivatives are generally defined as those instruments/contracts, where the value is based on other products, and/or on prices associated with financial products. Derivative contracts involve:
- Future delivery, receipt or exchange of financial items such as cash or another derivative instrument; or
- Future exchange of real assets for financial items where the contract may be tradeable and has a market value.
The contracts can either be binding on both parties (e.g. as with a currency swap) or subject to the exercise by one party of a right contained within the contract (as with options).

Report this item regardless of whether favourable or unfavourable to the reporting entity ie where it represents either a net gain or net loss to the entity across all open positions.

Net market value, or fair value, is the amount which could be expected to be received from the disposal of an asset in an orderly market; or in an arm's length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties; after deducting costs expected to be incurred in realising the proceeds of such a disposal.
