## definition
This is the value, as at the relevant date, of the shortfall in provisions for credit losses. 

The reporting party must compare:
     (a) the total expected loss (EL) amount (before any tax effects) for non-defaulted Internal Ratings Based (IRB) exposures to the total eligible provisions (net of any associated DTA) for non-defaulted IRB exposures; and
     (b) the total EL amount (before any tax effects) for defaulted IRB exposures to the total eligible provisions (net of any associated DTA) for defaulted IRB exposures.

In both cases, where the EL amount is higher than the eligible provisions, 50% of the difference must be reported at this item.

This item represents a 50/50 capital adequacy deduction, therefore only report 50 per cent of the asset amount at this item. This amount is to be deducted from both Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital.

This item is calculated for capital adequacy purposes and is to be determined in accordance with relevant Prudential Standards.
