## definition
This is the value of inwards risk transfers to an Official Monetary Authority (OMA) as at the relevant date, being the value of all claims in which the risk has been reallocated from an immediate counterparty that is not an OMA to a counterparty that is an OMA, by way of guarantees, collateral and banking book credit derivatives.
                                                                                                                  
The immediate counterparty is the one from whom the reporting party directly derives its return on investment in the financial asset and on whom the reporting party has the primary claim when liquidating the asset.
                                                                                                                                      
An OMA is usually a Central Bank, being a public financial entity that has the responsibility for monetary policy, issuing currency and/or holding a country's international reserves. This includes supranational monetary authorities such as the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and the European Central Bank (ECB).                                                                                                                                      
A claim is a financial asset and consists of money or a claim against another person or business (the counterparty) that can be converted into money.  It does not include intangible or operational assets of the reporting party nor does it include claims arising as a result of operational requirements of the business such as trade receivables or deferred tax assets.
