## definition
Record the amount paid during the relevant period to settle off balance sheet exposures related to liabilities classified as administration fees.

Adminitstration Fees are typically amounts payable to an entity for performing required administration activities.

The settlement of a liability takes place when all legal or constructive obligations are eliminated.

Off-balance sheet liability exposures relate to those liabilities or obligations that do not satisfy the recognition requirements of the relevant accounting standards and are therefore not recognised on the face of the balance sheet, or statement of financial position.
