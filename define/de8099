## definition
This is the scaling factor (Value at Risk(VaR))applicable for positions giving rise to equity position risk.The scaling factor consists of a multiplication factor and a plus factor, as determined in accordance with relevant prudential standards. The multiplication factor is set for each reporting party by APRA, and is subject to a minimum of three. A plus factor may also be required by APRA. This factor relates directly to back-testing results from the most recent 250 trading days prior to the relevant date.Equity positions include on and off-balance sheet exposures which are affected by changes in Equity prices. This includes holdings of, or positions in:     
- ordinary shares, whether voting or non-voting;
- convertible securities that behave like equities;
- commitments to buy or sell equity securities; and
- any other instruments that exhibit market behaviour similar to equities.

Back-testing represents the process of comparing the daily trading outcome (profit or loss) with the corresponding VaR number for that day.
