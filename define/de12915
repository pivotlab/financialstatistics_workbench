This is the value, as at the relevant date, of counterparty exposures to borrowings. Borrowings are generally amounts of money on loan from financial institutions or other creditors with the promise or understanding that it will be repaid.

An exposure to a counterparty or a group of related counterparties is the aggregate of all claims, commitments arising from on-balance sheet transactions with the counterparty or group of related counterparties. 

On-balance sheet refers to those assets, liabilities, or exposure items, which are recognised or recorded on the statement of financial position of the reporting entity, as determined in accordance with relevant Accounting Standards.
