## definition
Report the net value of all acquisition and disposal transactions of off balance sheet exposures related to assets classified as equity investments or securities. These transactions involve the exchange of valuable consideration between counterparties. Where this results in a net decrease in the net market value of equity securities, then report a negative figure.

Equity investments or securities are, as defined by the Australian Accounting Standards, contracts that evidence a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all its liabilities. This includes equity securities lent or sold by the entity under repurchase agreements, where the transaction does not result in the transfer of the rights of ownership of the securities away from the entity to another party. Also included are interests in joint ventures.

If the reporting entity holds listed notes/hybrid securities which have characteristics of a debt security & an equity security, these securities should be classified in the same manner as they appear in the entity's audited financial statements.

The acquisition cost, or historical cost, of an asset is the original cost paid to acquire the asset, at the date the asset was initially acquired. Where the asset was acquired in stages, sum the initial acquisition cost of each stage, but only to the extent the acquisitions occurred during the relevant period.

The disposal of an asset takes place if a change of ownership occurs, whether because of some act or event (such as damage) or by operation of law, e.g. when an asset is transferred from one person to another by way of sale or gift.

Off-balance sheet asset exposures relate to those assets or rights that do not satisfy the recognition requirements of the relevant accounting standards and are therefore not recognised on the face of the balance sheet, or statement of financial position, such as contingent assets, performance-related rights and guarantees.
