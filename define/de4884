## definition
Report the acquisition cost, or historical cost, of asset exposures, excluding those arising from contribution revenue. For the purposes of this item, only report those amounts acquired during the relevant period. Where an asset exposure is an amount held in a bank account, the value reported is the net of all movements in the account over the relevant period, but only where this net movement represents a net increase in the account's balance.

An asset exposure represents those assets or rights of an entity, recorded both on and off the balance sheet. 

An on-balance sheet exposure relates to those assets or rights recognised on the face of the balance sheet, or statement of financial position. An off-balance sheet exposure relates to those assets or rights that are not recognised on the face of the balance sheet, or statement of financial position, such as contingent assets, performance-related rights and guarantees.

Assets are to be determined in accordance with relevant accounting standards.

The acquisition cost, or historical cost, of an asset is the original cost paid to acquire the asset, at the date the asset was initially acquired. Where the asset was acquired in stages, sum the initial acquisition cost of each stage, but only to the extent the acquisitions occurred during the relevant period.
