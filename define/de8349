## definition
This is the value, as at the relevant date, of bought foreign exchange and gold put options, consistent with the classification and measurement basis used for derivatives by institutions in accordance with accounting standards.

A bought put option is a put option that has been purchased by an entity. It provides the purchasing entity with the right but not the obligation to pay or receive a specific amount of money based on a pre-agreed rate or price, on or before a specific future date.

A foreign exchange contract is any contract that transfers the exchange rate risk of an underlying asset from one party to another.

A gold contract is any contract that transfers the gold price risk associated with an underlying asset from one party to another.

Derivatives are generally defined as those instruments/contracts, where the value is based on other products, and/or on prices associated with financial products. Derivative contracts involve:
- Future delivery, receipt or exchange of financial items such as cash or another derivative instrument; or
- Future exchange of real assets for financial items where the contract may be tradeable and has a market value.
The contracts can either be binding on both parties (e.g. as with a currency swap) or subject to the exercise by one party of a right contained within the contract (as with options).

Report this item regardless of whether favourable or unfavourable to the reporting entity.
