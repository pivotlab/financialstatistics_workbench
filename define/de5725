## definition
This is a balancing item in the list in which it is being used.

Report the acquisition cost, or historical cost, of on balance sheet investment assets, excluding those arising from contribution revenue. For the purposes of this item, only report those amounts acquired, or initially recognised, during the relevant period. Where an asset is an amount held in a bank account, the value reported is the net of all movements in the account over the relevant period, but only where this net movement represents a net increase in the account's balance.

This balancing item represents total on balance sheet investment assets (excluding contribution revenue) less those assets categorised as any of the following:
- Cash and liquid assets
- Receivables
- Equity securities and unit trusts
- Cash and fixed interest investments
- Investment loans and advances
- Investment Property
- Balanced or mixed mandates, or those mandates which are unable to be allocated across this list of asset classes.

Assets are to be determined in accordance with relevant accounting standards.

The acquisition cost, or historical cost, of an asset is the original cost paid to acquire the asset, at the date the asset was initially acquired. Where the asset was acquired in stages, sum the initial acquisition cost of each stage, but only to the extent the acquisitions occurred during the relevant period.
