## definition
This is the value, as at the relevant date, of exposures arising from undrawn eligible facilities, excluding eligible servicer cash advance facilities and applicable revolving facilities.

Revolving facility exposures are exposures arising from redrawable facilities, other than exposures in the nature of redrawable home loans where the amounts likely to be redrawn are expected to be immaterial relative to the size of the pool. Revolving facilities are only applicable to this item where the reporting party transfers a pool of revolving exposures into a securitisation that contains an early amortisation provision.
