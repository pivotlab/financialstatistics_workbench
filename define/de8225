# Assets Derivative Financial Instruments And Undrawn Commitments Amount

## identifier
de8225

## type
float

## definition
This is the value, as at the relevant date, of both derivative contracts and other undrawn (off-balance sheet) lending commitments where timing of the interest rate repricing is known.

Derivatives are to be reported consistent with the classification and measurement basis used for derivatives by institutions in accordance with accounting standards.

The amount of each commitment reported will represent the maximum unused portion of the commitment that could be drawn during the remaining period to maturity. Any drawn portion of a commitment forms part of an entity's on-balance sheet exposure and is not to be reported at this item.

Commitments are generally considered to have arisen once the reporting party makes a firm offer to a client (i.e. customer acceptance is not required). Therefore, a commitment will arise once a letter of offer is provided to the client by the reporting party.

Derivatives are generally defined as those instruments/contracts, where the value is based on other products, and/or on prices associated with financial products. Derivative contracts involve:
- Future delivery, receipt or exchange of financial items such as cash or another derivative instrument; or
- Future exchange of real assets for financial items where the contract may be tradeable and has a market value.
The contracts can either be binding on both parties (e.g. as with a currency swap) or subject to the exercise by one party of a right contained within the contract (as with options).

Report derivatives regardless of whether favourable or unfavourable to the reporting entity.
