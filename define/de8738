## definition
This is the value of the reporting party's actual exposure to commercial industrial property, which should include:
     - claims and commitments recorded on-balance sheet; and
     - the credit equivalent amounts of off-balance sheet claims and commitments.
     
Commercial property exposure is defined according to the nature of the risk. An exposure should be classified as commercial property risk, if the exposure is subject to the performance of the property market.
     
For reporting purposes, an exposure exists when a facility has been provided for the development, acquisition or improvement of Industrial property, and the servicing and repayment of the facility is dependent on the cash flows generated by the Industrial property itself through sale or rental income, and/or from cash flows generated from other Industrial properties owned by the borrower.

Commercial industrial property may include for example, warehouses and factories.
