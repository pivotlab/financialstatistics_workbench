## definition
This is the value, as at the relevant date, of undrawn irrevocable commitments in the form of formal standby facilities and credit lines to the reporting party's customers and APRA industry support arrangements only. This represents the maximum unused portion of the commitment that could be drawn during the remaining period to maturity. This does not include standby facilities in place to support the reporting party's operations.
     
A formal standby facility or credit line is a formalised arrangement in which the counterparty has the right but not the obligation to draw down funds to a specified limit.

Commitments, for capital adequacy purposes, are generally considered to have arisen once the reporting party makes a firm offer to a client (i.e. customer acceptance is not required). Therefore, a commitment will arise once a letter of offer is provided to the client by the reporting party.

For the purposes of this item, do not report undrawn balances of revolving facilities.
