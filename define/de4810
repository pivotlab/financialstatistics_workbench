## definition
Record the net market value or fair value of the entity's liabilities.

Liabilities, as defined by the Australian Accounting Standards, are present obligations of the entity arising from past events, the settlement of which is expected to result in an outflow from the entity of resources embodying economic benefits.

Net market value or fair value is the amount which could be expected to be received from the disposal of a liability in an orderly market; or in an arm's length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties; after deducting costs expected to be incurred in realising the proceeds of such a disposal.
