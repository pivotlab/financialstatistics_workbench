## definition
In reporting this item the reporting party is to follow the basis that is used for the preparation of the annual financial statements in accordance with the Australian accounting standards. Actuarial valuations and calculations used in deriving the value of the item must be in accordance with prudential standards.

Report the principal amount of assets sold with recourse. These are non-market related off-balance sheet asset sales (to the extent that such assets are not included in on-balance sheet) by an entity where the holder of the asset is entitled to 'put' the asset back to the entity within an agreed period or under certain prescribed circumstances, e.g. deterioration in the value or credit quality of the asset concerned.

The principal amount refers to the face value or gross amount of a given off-balance sheet transaction and not the fair value. The principal amount must be reported as a positive value, even for short positions in derivative financial instruments.
