## definition
This is the value, as at the relevant date, of equity securities and of subordinated debt securities.

Equity securities are, as defined by the Australian Accounting Standards, contracts that evidence a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all its liabilities. This includes equity securities lent or sold by the entity under repurchase agreements, where the transaction does not result in the transfer of the rights of ownership of the securities away from the entity to another party.

Debt securities are transferable instruments evidencing a relationship of indebtedness. They are characterised by having a definable return that is not based on the economic performance of the issuing entity. The value of this item is to be determined in accordance with accounting standards.

Subordinated debt is a debt where the claim to repayment ranks lower in priority to other claims.
