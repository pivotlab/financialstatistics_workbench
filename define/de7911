## definition
This is the value, as at the relevant date, of irrevocable loan amounts that are approved but not yet advanced, and which are certain of drawdown. This represents the maximum unused portion of the commitment that could be drawn during the remaining period to maturity. Any drawn portion of a commitment forms part of an entity's on-balance sheet exposure and is not to be reported at this item.
     
Loans that are approved but not yet advanced are contingent liabilities which represent loans that have been approved by the reporting party but the counterparty has yet to draw down the funds in relation to the arrangement.
     
Commitments, for capital adequacy purposes, are generally considered to have arisen once the reporting party makes a firm offer to a client (i.e. customer acceptance is not required). Therefore, a commitment will arise once a letter of offer is provided to the client by the reporting party.
      
For the purposes of this item, do not report the undrawn balance of revolving facilities (e.g. credit cards, overdrafts, etc.).
