## definition
Report the net market value, or fair value, of holdings of infrastructure property investments. For prudential reporting purposes a property investment exists where the investment (earnings and capital value) are dependent on the cash flows generated by the property through sale or rental income.

Exclude direct investments in property trusts (both listed and unlisted). 

Net market value, or fair value, is the amount which could be expected to be received from the disposal of an asset in an orderly market; or in an arm's length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties; after deducting costs expected to be incurred in realising the proceeds of such a disposal.
