A Bill of Exchange is a written order requiring one party to pay a specified sum of money to another party at a future maturity date. It is a negotiable instrument which is usually sold at a discount and traded on the money market. Bills of exchange can be bank-accepted or bank-endorsed, or can rank as commercial bills.

Net market value, or fair value, is the amount which could be expected to be received from the disposal of an asset in an orderly market; or in an arm's length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties; after deducting costs expected to be incurred in realising the proceeds of such a disposal.
