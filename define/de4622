## type
float

## definition
Report the value of the effective movement in net policy liabilities, calculated as:
- increase/(decrease) in net policy liabilities;
- less deposits received;
- plus withdrawals of deposits;
- plus non-premium related fees for management services (which would otherwise be recognised as a reduction in policy liabilities);
- plus movements in the liability for deferred fee revenue (which are reported as part of Fees for Management Services Rendered but would otherwise result in a change in policy liabilities for Investment Contracts);
- less movements in the liability for deferred acquisition costs (which are reported as part of Operating Expenses but would otherwise result in a change in policy liabilities for Investment Contracts).
