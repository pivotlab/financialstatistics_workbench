## definition
Report the value of proceeds received or receivable on the disposal of off balance sheet exposures related to assets classified as balanced or mixed mandates during the relevant period.

The disposal of an asset takes place if a change of ownership occurs, whether because of some act or event (such as damage) or by operation of law, e.g. when an asset is transferred from one person to another by way of sale or gift.

Proceeds are defined as the total consideration recieved or receivable following the disposal of an asset.

Off-balance sheet asset exposures relate to those assets or rights that do not satisfy the recognition requirements of the relevant accounting standards and are therefore not recognised on the face of the balance sheet, or statement of financial position, such as contingent assets, performance-related rights and guarantees.
