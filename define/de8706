For reporting purposes, an exposure exists when a facility has been provided for the development, acquisition or improvement of Industrial property, and the servicing and repayment of the facility is dependent on the cash flows generated by the Industrial property itself through sale or rental income, and/or from cash flows generated from other Industrial properties owned by the borrower.

Industrial commercial property may include for example, warehouses and factories.
