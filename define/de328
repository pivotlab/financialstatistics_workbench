## definition
Capital expenditure is the expenditure by an entity of a significant amount for the purchase or improvement of a fixed asset; the amount expended would warrant the item being depreciated over an estimated useful life of a reasonably extended period. Capital expenditure is not charged against the profits of the entity when it takes place, but is regarded as an investment to be capitalised in the balance sheet as a fixed asset and subsequently charged against profits by depreciating the asset over its estimated useful life.

Road vehicles refer to vehicles driven by a motor, usually an internal combustion engine, such as a motor car, bus, truck, motorcycle or the like, made for travel on roadways open for the passage of road vehicles. It excludes tractors.

Capital expenditure for road vehicles is limited to the cost of the motor vehicle and associated capitalised costs only (e.g. road vehicle transfer costs incurred upon acquiring the asset) and does not include capital expenditure on any other asset types.
