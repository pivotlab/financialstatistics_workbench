This is the value of provisions for impairment of the reporting party's exposure to commercial property.
     
Commercial property exposure is defined according to the nature of the risk. An exposure should be classified as commercial property risk, if the exposure is subject to the performance of the property market.
     
For reporting purposes, an exposure exists when a facility has been provided for the development, acquisition or improvement of commercial property, and the servicing and repayment of the facility is dependent on the cash flows generated by the property itself through sale or rental income, and/or from cash flows generated from other commercial properties owned by the borrower.
