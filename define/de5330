## definition
Report the proceeds received or receivable on the disposal of equity investments or securities during the relevant period.

Equity investments or securities are, as defined by the Australian Accounting Standards, contracts that evidence a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all its liabilities. This includes equity securities lent or sold by the entity under repurchase agreements, where the transaction does not result in the transfer of the rights of ownership of the securities away from the entity to another party. Also included are interests in joint ventures.

If the reporting entity holds notes/hybrid securities which have characteristics of a debt security & an equity security, these securities should be classified in the same manner as they appear in the entity's audited financial statements.

The disposal of an asset takes place if a change of ownership occurs, whether because of some act or event (such as damage) or by operation of law, e.g. when an asset is transferred from one person to another by way of sale or gift.

Proceeds are defined as the total consideration recieved or receivable following the disposal of an asset.
