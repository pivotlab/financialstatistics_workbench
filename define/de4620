## definition
Report the net value of all acquisition and disposal transactions of off balance sheet exposures related to assets classified as trade and other receivables. These transactions involve the exchange of valuable consideration between counterparties. Where this results in a net decrease in the net market value of assets, then report a negative figure.

The acquisition cost, or historical cost, of an asset is the original cost paid to acquire the asset, at the date the asset was initially acquired. Where the asset was acquired in stages, sum the initial acquisition cost of each stage, but only to the extent the acquisitions occurred during the relevant period.

The disposal of an asset takes place if a change of ownership occurs, whether because of some act or event (such as damage) or by operation of law, e.g. when an asset is transferred from one person to another by way of sale or gift.

Off-balance sheet asset exposures relate to those assets or rights that do not satisfy the recognition requirements of the relevant accounting standards and are therefore not recognised on the face of the balance sheet, or statement of financial position, such as contingent assets, performance-related rights and guarantees.
