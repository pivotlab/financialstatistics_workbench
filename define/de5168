## definition
Report the ratio of the capital requirements reserve to the sum of the termination value (as per the solvency standard) and other liabilities.

The Solvency Reserve Ratio should be calculated as:
SR / Absolute(MTV + OL)
where:
SR = the amount reserved, including the amount of any investment linked risk margin (see below), in accordance with the relevant capital requirements standard

MTV = the minimum termination value (net of reinsurance) excluding the amount of any investment linked risk margin (see below)

OL = Other Liabilities - the total liabilities as determined in accordance with the relevant accounting standards, other than Policy Liabilities, Approved Eligible Subordinated Debt and Seed Capital.

The minimum termination value (MTV) is determined by the prudential standards as the amount that a life insurer is obliged to pay to policyholders if they decided to voluntarily terminate their policies at the relevant date. The obligation might be contractual, statutory or a result of past practice. Calculated as the greater of: 
a) the lowest Termination Value that the reporting party is obliged to pay; and 
b) the amount calculated in accordance with the Surrender Value Standard.

The investment linked (IL) risk margin reflects the additional risks that may be borne by the reporting party in conducting investment-linked business.
