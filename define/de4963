## definition
Report the value of admissible assets with non-standard resilience factors at the adjusted yield, as per the capital adequacy standard.

The Adjusted Yield is determined in accordance with the capital adequacy standard and is applied to the value of the admissible assets as part of the calculation of the Resilience Reserve. The Resilience Reserve is determined as the additional amount that needs to be held before the happening of a prescribed set of changes in the economic environment ( as per the capital adequacy standard), such that after the changes the admissible assets of the reporting party are able to meet the policy owner and other liabilities of the statutory fund, in an ongoing business context.

The value of admissible assets with non-standard resilience factors is the net market value, or fair value, of assets where the actuary has considered that non-standard resilience factors are appropriate.

This should only be used in rare cases. It is intended to cover situations where assets are disaggregated into (1) an identifiable sub-asset and (2) a residual that does not fit into any of the asset sectors specified by Life Insurance Prudential Standards for resilience purposes, or where a non-standard resilience risk has been modelled in accordance with Life Insurance Prudential Standards.

Net market value, or fair value, is the amount which could be expected to be received from the disposal of an asset in an orderly market; or in an arm's length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties; after deducting costs expected to be incurred in realising the proceeds of such a disposal.
