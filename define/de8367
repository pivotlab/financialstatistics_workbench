## definition
This is a balancing item in the list in which it is being used.

This balancing item represents total derivative contracts, as determined according to accounting standards as at the relevant date, (other than options or credit derivatives) that are not classified as any of the following:
- Interest rate contracts;
- Foreign exchange contracts;
- Gold contracts; 
- Precious metals contracts; or 
- Equity contracts.

Options includes both put and call options that have been purchased or sold by an entity. It provides the reporting party with the right to buy (for call options) or the obligation to sell  (for put options) a specific amount of the underlying asset at a pre-agreed price, on or before a specific future date.

A credit derivative enables the user to transfer the credit risk of an underlying asset from one party, the protection buyer, to another, the protection seller, in isolation from other risks.

Derivatives are generally defined as those instruments/contracts, where the value is based on other products, and/or on prices associated with financial products. Derivative contracts involve:
- Future delivery, receipt or exchange of financial items such as cash or another derivative instrument; or
- Future exchange of real assets for financial items where the contract may be tradeable and has a market value.
The contracts can either be binding on both parties (e.g. as with a currency swap) or subject to the exercise by one party of a right contained within the contract (as with options).

Report this item regardless of whether favourable or unfavourable to the reporting entity.
