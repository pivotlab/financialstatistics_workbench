This item is reported for capital adequacy purposes and is to be determined in accordance with relevant prudential standards.

A sold credit derivative is a credit derivative that has been sold, or written, by an entity. A credit derivative enables the user to transfer the credit risk of an underlying asset from one party, the protection buyer, to another, the protection seller, in isolation from other risks.

A direct credit substitute is an irrevocable off-balance sheet obligation that carries the same credit risk as a direct extension of credit, such as an undertaking to make a payment to a third party in the event that a counterparty fails to meet a financial obligation.
