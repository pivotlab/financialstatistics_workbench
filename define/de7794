## definition
This is the value, as at the relevant date, of term subordinated debt classified as Lower Tier 2 capital.

Term subordinated debt instruments have significant deficiencies as constituents of capital in view of their fixed maturity and inability to absorb losses except in a liquidation. These deficiencies justify an additional restriction on the amount of such debt capital which is eligible for inclusion within the capital base.

This item is calculated for capital adequacy purposes and is to be determined in accordance with relevant prudential standards.
