# Liabilities Off Balance Sheet Floating Charge Granted Over Assets Amount

## identifier
de7936

## type
float

## definition
This is the value, as at the relevant date, of the floating charge that has been granted over the assets of the reporting party.

A floating charge is a form of security provided by a borrower to a lender where the creditor's charge or claim is not lodged over a particular asset, but is fixed on a specific asset, or group of assets, only if the default occurs. This process is called crystallisation of the charge. A floating charge leaves the debtor free to buy, sell and vary the assets until such time as the charge is crystallised.
