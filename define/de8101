This factor relates directly to back-testing results from the most recent 250 trading days prior to the relevant date.Commodity positions include both on and off-balance sheet exposures which are affected by changes in commodity prices. 

This includes holdings of, or positions in:

Back-testing represents the process of comparing the daily trading outcome (profit or loss) with the corresponding VaR number for that day.
