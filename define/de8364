## definition
This is the value, as determined in accordance with accounting standards as at the relevant date, of foreign exchange and gold forward contracts, swap contracts and other foreign exchange and gold contracts that are not classified as : 
     - Bought options;
     - Written (sold) options: or
     - Credit derivatives - bought or sold protection.

A forward contract is an agreement to exchange a predetermined amount of currency, commodity, or other financial instrument at a specified future date and at a predetermined price.

A Swap is a financial instrument representing a transaction in which two parties agree to swap or exchange some obligation, generally a series of cash flows on differing terms.

A bought option includes both put and call options that have been purchased by an entity. It provides the purchasing entity with the right but not the obligation to buy (call options) or sell (put options) a specific amount of the underlying asset at a pre-agreed price, on or before a specific future date.

A bought credit derivative is a credit derivative that has been purchased by an entity. A credit derivative enables the user to transfer the credit risk of an underlying asset from one party, the protection buyer, to another, the protection seller, in isolation from other risks.

A sold credit derivative is a credit derivative that has been sold, or written, by an entity. 

A foreign exchange contract is any contract that transfers the exchange rate risk of an underlying asset from one party to another.

A gold contract is any contract that transfers the gold price risk associated with an underlying asset from one party to another.

Derivatives are generally defined as those instruments/contracts, where the value is based on other products, and/or on prices associated with financial products. Derivative contracts involve:
- Future delivery, receipt or exchange of financial items such as cash or another derivative instrument; or
- Future exchange of real assets for financial items where the contract may be tradeable and has a market value.
The contracts can either be binding on both parties (e.g. as with a currency swap) or subject to the exercise by one party of a right contained within the contract (as with options).

Report this item regardless of whether favourable or unfavourable to the reporting entity.
