## definition
The value to be reported is the net market value, or fair value, of indexed debt securities including income accrued but not received. This method of disclosure differs from the Australian Accounting Standards.

Debt securities are transferable instruments evidencing a relationship of indebtedness. It is characterised by having a definable income stream that is not based on the economic performance of the issuing entity.

Indexed debt securities pay an income stream that is dependent on an external factor.

Net market value, or fair value, is the amount which could be expected to be received from the disposal of an asset in an orderly market; or in an arm's length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties; after deducting costs expected to be incurred in realising the proceeds of such a disposal.
