## definition
Report the net market value, or fair value, of off balance sheet exposures related to assets classified as investment property.

For prudential reporting purposes a property investment exists where the investment (earnings and capital value) are dependent on the cash flows generated by the property through sale or rental income. 

Include: 
- Property investments acquired as part of the internal investment management of the reporting party; and 
- Underlying property investments held in the form of an external individually managed mandate/portfolio or discretely managed portfolio. 
Exclude: 
- Direct investments in property trusts (both listed and unlisted).

Net market value, or fair value, is the amount which could be expected to be received from the disposal of an asset in an orderly market; or in an arm's length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties; after deducting costs expected to be incurred in realising the proceeds of such a disposal.

Off-balance sheet asset exposures relate to those assets or rights that do not satisfy the recognition requirements of the relevant accounting standards and are therefore not recognised on the face of the balance sheet, or statement of financial position, such as contingent assets, performance-related rights and guarantees.
