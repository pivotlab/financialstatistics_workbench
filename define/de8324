This item is to be reported on a net basis, meaning net of the following: 
     - exposures to the extent that they are secured by cash deposits (subject to satisfying the criteria in APS 112);
     - exposures to the extent that they are guaranteed by, or secured against securities issued by, governments or central banks (subject to satisfying the conditions in APS 112); 
     - exposures arising in the course of settlement of market-related contracts; and 
     - exposures to the extent that they have been written off or specifically provided for. 

On-balance sheet refers to those assets, or exposure items, which are recognised or recorded on the statement of financial position of the reporting party, as determined in accordance with relevant accounting standards.
