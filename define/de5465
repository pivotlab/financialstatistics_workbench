## definition
In reporting this item the reporting party is to follow the basis that is used for the preparation of the annual financial statements in accordance with the Australian accounting standards. Actuarial valuations and calculations used in deriving the value of the item must be in accordance with prudential standards.

Report the principal amount of forward asset purchases. These are non-market related off-balance sheet commitments to purchase assets at a future date and on pre-arranged terms. This includes a loan, security or other asset from another party, including written put options on specified assets with the character of a credit enhancement.
Where an entity purchasing the asset has an unequivocal right to substitute cash settlement in place of accepting delivery of the asset, and the price on settlement is calculated with reference to a general market price indicator (and not to the financial condition of any specific entity), the purchase may be treated as a market-related off-balance sheet transaction.
Written put options expressed in terms of market rates for currencies or financial instruments bearing no credit risk are excluded.

The principal amount refers to the face value or gross amount of a given off-balance sheet transaction and not the fair value. The principal amount must be reported as a positive value, even for short positions in derivative financial instruments.
