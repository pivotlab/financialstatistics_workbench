## definition
Report the amount of preserved benefits of the accumulation benefit members of the reporting entity as at the relevant date.

Preserved benefits are vested benefits which must either be retained in the reporting entity or transferred to another entity. These benefits cannot be paid to the member until they reach a condition of release such as retirement.

Accumulation benefit members are those members whose entitlements in the reporting entity are entirely determined on the basis of contributions into the reporting entity, adjusted for earnings, fees and taxes.
