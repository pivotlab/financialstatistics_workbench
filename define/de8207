## definition
This is the value of goods financed, or to be financed, under finance leases, for which new commitments have been provided by the reporting party during the relevant period, regardless of whether or not they have subsequently been withdrawn, or cancelled, during or after the period. This excludes commitments for commercial hire purchase agreements, for debt participation in leverages lease agreements, and for leveraged leases which are finance leases where the lessor provides a portion of the finance, with the major portion usually provided by long-term creditors and where the creditor's recourse to the lessor is restricted to the proceeds from disposal of the leased asset and any unremitted lease payments. 

Goods may be valued using one of the following methods:
     - the capital cost of new goods;
     - the written-down value of goods re-leased;
     - the purchase price of second-hand goods;
     - where the full value of the goods under lease is not financed by one corporation (e.g. a partnership and syndicated leases), the value is your share of the full value, not equity participation; or
     - in the case of revolving lease facilities, such as master leases, report the value of goods acquired at each drawdown against such facilities. Do not report the value of commitments to provide a leasing limit or to increase a leasing limit.

A commitment is a firm offer to provide finance which has been accepted by the client. A commitment generally exists once the loan application has been approved, and a loan contract or letter of offer has been issued to the borrower. 

A Finance Lease refers to the leasing or hiring of tangible assets under an agreement (other than a hire purchase agreement) which transfers from the lessor to the lessee substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the assets, without transferring the legal ownership.
