## definition
This item is the balancing item in the list in which it appears.

Report the face value, or gross amount, of other derivative contracts held by the reporting party as at the relevant date. The value of this item is to be determined in accordance with accounting standards.

This balancing item represents the principal value of total derivative financial instruments less those derivatives which are classed as any of the following:
- Interest rate contracts;
- Foreign exchange and gold contracts; or
- Equity contracts;

Derivatives are generally defined as those instruments/contracts, where the value is based on other products, and/or on prices associated with financial products. Derivative contracts involve:
- Future delivery, receipt or exchange of financial items such as cash or another derivative instrument; or
- Future exchange of real assets for financial items where the contract may be tradeable and has a market value.
The contracts can either be binding on both parties (e.g. as with a currency swap) or subject to the exercise by one party of a right contained within the contract (as with options).

Report this item regardless of whether favourable or unfavourable to the reporting entity ie where it represents either a net gain or net loss to the entity across all open positions.

The principal amount must be reported as a positive value, even for short positions in derivative financial instruments.
