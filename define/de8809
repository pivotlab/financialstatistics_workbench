## definition
This is the value, as at the relevant date, all credit substitutes that are not transacted in financial markets.

A credit substitute is any transaction that exposes the reporting party to counterparty credit risk that is not a direct extension of credit. Counterparty credit risk is the risk that the counterparty to the transaction will not fulfil their obligations under the contract. A direct extension of credit is where the reporting party provides funds or other on-balance sheet assets to the counterparty in the expectation that they will be repaid at some future date.
