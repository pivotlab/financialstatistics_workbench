# Liabilities Insurance Outstanding Claims Provision Net Amount

## identifier
de8523

## type
float

## definition
This is the value, as at the relevant date, of the outstanding claims provision (OCP), net of any recoveries that relate to the gross OCP, as determined in accordance with relevant prudential standards.

OCP relates to all claims incurred prior to the valuation date, whether or not they have been reported to the insurer. The value of the OCP must include an amount in respect of the expenses that the insurer expects to incur in settling these claims. The value of OCP must not include any Government charges directly imposed on the insurer such as levies, duties and taxes.

The OCP will be measured as the present value of the future expected net payments, i.e. discounted for future investment income, plus a risk margin determined in accordance with relevant prudential standards.
